**PERIODIC CLASSIFIC**

"An awareness of the periodic table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements **"**

**\- Glenn T. Seaborg**

Glenn T. Seaborg

Glenn Theodore Seaborg received Nobel Prize in 1951 in chemistry for the discoveries of trans-uranium elements. He was the co-discoverer of plutonium and other trans- uranium elements. He along with his colleagues has discovered over a hundred isotopes of other elements. He demonstrated that actinide elements are analogues to rare earth series of lanthanide elements.

**Introduction**

There are millions of chemical compounds existing in nature with different compositions and properties, formed from less than 100 naturally occurring elements.

The discovery of elements is linked with human civilization. In stone age, man has used some metals to suit his needs without knowing that they are elements. Soon he learnt to extract elements from ores and fashion them into his daily life. Over the years, more and more elements were discovered. In 1789, Lavoisier from France, published the first list of chemical elements containing 23 elements after several experimental investigations.

Antoine Lavoisier classified the substances into four groups of elements namely acid-making elements, gas-like elements, metallic elements and earthy elements

**3.1 Classification of Elements**

During the 19th century, scientists have isolated several elements and the list of known elements increased. Currently, we have 118 known elements. Out of 118 elements, 92 elements with atomic numbers 1 to 92 are found in nature. Scientists have found out there are some similarities in properties among certain elements. This observation has led to the idea of classification of elements based on their properties. In fact, classification will be beneficial for the effective utilization of these elements. Several attempts were made to classify the elements. However, classification based on the atomic weights led to the construction of a proper form of periodic table.

In 1817, J. W. Döbereiner classified some elements such as chlorine, bromine and iodine with similar chemical properties into the group of three elements called as triads. In triads, the atomic weight of the middle element nearly equal to the arithmetic mean of the atomic weights of the remaining two elements. However, only a limited number of elements can be grouped as triads.

|------|------|
| cobalt, mercur y, tin |lime (calcium oxide) |
| copper, nickel, iron |magnesia (magne-sium oxide) |
| gold, lead, silver, zinc |bar ytes (barium sulphate) |
| manganese, tungten |argilla (aluminium oxide) |
| platina (platinum) |silex (silicon diox-ide) |

**S. No. Elements in the Triad**

**Atomic weight of middle element**

1 Li, Na, K 23

2 Cl, Br, I 80

3 Ca, Sr, Ba 88

This concept can not be extended to some triads which have nearly same atomic masses such as \[Fe, Co, Ni\], \[Ru, Rh, Pd\] and \[Os, Ir, Pt\].

In 1862, A. E. B. de Chancourtois reported a correlation between the properties of the elements and their atomic weights. He said ‘the properties of bodies are the properties of numbers’. He intended the term numbers to mean the value of atomic weights. He designed a helix by tracing at an angle 45˚ to the vertical axis of a cylinder with circumference of 16 units. He arranged the elements in the increasing atomic weights along the helix on the surface of this cylinder. One complete turn of a helix corresponds to an atomic weight increase of 16. Elements which lie on the 16 equidistant vertical lines drawn on the surface of cylinder shows similar properties. This was the first reasonable attempt towards the creation of periodic table. However, it did not attract much attention.

In 1864, J. Newland made an attempt to classify the elements and proposed the law of octaves. On arranging the elements in the increasing order of atomic weights, he observed that the properties of every

**3.1.1 Mendeleev's Classification**

In 1868, Lothar Meyer had developed a table of the elements that closely resembles the modern periodic table. He plotted the physical properties such as atomic volume, melting point and boiling point against atomic weight and observed a periodical pattern.

During same period Dmitri Mendeleev independently proposed that “the properties of the elements are the periodic functions of their atomic weights” and this is called periodic law. Mendeleev listed 70 elements, which were known till histime in several vertical columns in order of increasing atomic weights. Thus, Mendeleev constructed the first periodic table based on the periodic law.

The plot of υ against Z gives a straight line. Using this relationship, we can determine the atomic number of an unknown (new) element from the frequency of X-ray emitted.

Based on his work, the modern periodic law was developed which states that, “the physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.” Based on this law, the elements were arranged in order of their increasing atomic numbers. This mode of arrangement reveals an important truth that the elements with similar properties recur after regular intervals. The repetition of physical and chemical properties at regular intervals is called periodicity.

**3.2.1 Modern Periodic Table**

The physical and chemical properties of the elements are correlated to the arrangement of electrons in their outermost shell (valence shell). Different elements having similar outer shell electronic configuration possess similar properties. For example, elements having one electron in their valence shell s-orbital possess similar physical and chemical properties. These elements are grouped together in the modern periodic table as first group elements.

Similarly, all the elements are arranged in the modern periodic table which contains 18 vertical columns and 7 horizontal rows. The vertical columns are called groups and the horizontal rows are called periods. Groups are numbered 1 to 18 in accordance with the IUPAC recommendation which replaces the old numbering scheme IA to VIIA, IB to VIIB and VIII.

Each period starts with the element having general outer electronic configuration ns1 and ends with ns2 np6. Here ‘n’ corresponds to the period number (principal quantum number). The aufbau principle and the electronic configuration of atoms provide a theoretical foundation for the modern periodic table.

**3.5 Periodic Trends in Properties**

As discussed earlier, the electronic configuration of the elements shows a periodic variation with increase in atomic numbers. Similarly a periodic trend is observed in physical and chemical behaviour of elements. In this section, we will study the periodic trends in the following properties of elements.

1\. Atomic radius

2\. Ionic radius

3\. Ionisation enthalpy (energy)

4\. Electron gain enthalpy (electron affinity)

5\. Electronegativity

**3.5.1 Atomic radius**

Atomic radius of an atom is defined as the distance between the centre of its nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron.

It is not possible to measure the radius of an isolated atom directly. Except for noble gases, usually atomic radius is referred to as covalent radius or metallic radius depending upon the nature of bonding between the concerned atoms.

r

**Figure 3.1 )a) Atomic radius**  

**Covalent radius**

It is one-half of the internuclear distance between two identical atoms linked together by a single covalent bond. Inter nuclear distance can be determined using x-ray diffraction studies.

d

r

**Figure 3.1 )b) Atomic and covalent radius**

**Example:** The experimental internuclear distance in Cl2 molecule is 1.98 Å. The covalent radius of chlorine is calculated as below.

dCl-Cl = rCl + rCl

⇒ dCl-Cl = 2rCl

⇒ rCl =

⇒ rCl 1.98 2= = 0.99Å

Cl Cl1.98Å covalent diameter

**Figure 3.1 )c) Covalent radius of Cl**

The formation of covalent bond involves the overlapping of atomic orbitals and it reduces the expected internuclear distance. Therefore covalent radius is always shorter than the actual atomic radius.

dCl-Cl 2




  

In case of hetero nuclear diatomic molecules, the covalent radius of individual atom can also be calculated using the internuclear distance (dA-B) between two different atoms A and B. The simplest method proposed by Schomaker and Stevenson is as follows.

dA-B = rA + rB - 0.09 (χA-χB)

where χA and χB are the electronegativities of A and B respectively in Pauling units. Here χA > χB and radius is in Å.

Let us calculate the covalent radius of hydrogen using the experimental dH-Cl value is 1.28 Å and the covalent radius of chlorine is 0.99 Å. In pauling scale the electronegativity of chlorine and hydrogen are 3 and 2.1 respectively.

dH-Cl = rH + rCl - 0.09 ( χCl - χH)

1.28 = rH + 0.99 - 0.09 (3 - 2.1)

1.28 = rH + 0.99 - 0.09 (0.9)

1.28 = rH + 0.99 - 0.081

1.28 = rH + 0.909

∴ rH = 1.28 - 0.909 = 0.371 Å

**Metallic radius**

It is defined as one-half of the distance between two adjacent metal atoms in the closely packed metallic crystal lattice.

For example, the distance between the adjacent copper atoms in solid copper is 2.56 Å and therefore the metallic radius of copper is

2.56 2

\= 1.28 Å  

The metallic radius can be calculated using the unit cell length of the metallic crystal. You will study the detailed calculation procedure in XII

standard solid state unit.

**Periodic Trends in Atomic Radius**

**Variation in Periods**

Atomic radius tends to decrease in a period. As we move from left to right along a period, the valence electrons are added to the same shell. The simultaneous addition of protons to the nucleus, increases the nuclear charge, as well as the electrostatic attractive force between the valence electrons and the nucleus. Therefore atomic radius decreases along a period.

**Effective nuclear charge**

In addition to the electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, there exists repulsive forces among the electrons. The repulsive force between the inner shell electrons and the valence electrons leads to a decrease in the electrostatic attractive forces acting on the valence electrons by the nucleus. Thus, the inner shell electrons act as a shield between the nucleus and the valence electrons. This effect is called shielding effect.

The net nuclear charge experienced by valence electrons in the outermost shell is called the effective nuclear charge. It is approximated by the below mentioned equation.

Zeff = Z - S




  

Where Z is the atomic number and 'S' is the screening constant which can be calculated using Slater's rules as described below. **Step 1** : Write the electronic configuration of the atom and rearrange it by grouping ns and np orbitals together and others separately in the following form. (1s) (2s, 2p) (3s, 3p) (3d) (4s, 4p) (4d) (4f) (5s, 5p)... **Step 2 :** Identify the group in which the electron of interest is present. The electron present right to this group does not contribute to the shielding effect. Each of the electrons within the identified group (denoted by 'n') shields to an extent of 0.35 unit of nuclear charge. However, it is 0.30 unit for 1s electron. **Step 3** : Shielding of inner shell electrons. If the electron of interest belongs to either s or p orbital, i) each electron within the (n-1) group

shields to an extent of 0.85 unit of nuclear charge, and

ii) each electron within the (n-2) group (or) even lesser group (n-3), (n-4) etc... completely shields i.e. to an extent of 1.00 unit of nuclear charge.

If the electron of interest belongs to d or f orbital, then each of electron left of the group of electron of interest shields to an extent of 1.00 unit of nuclear charge. **Step 4** : Summation of the shielding effect of all the electrons gives the shielding constant 'S'  

**Example:** Let us explain the calculation of effective nuclear charge on 4s electron and 3d electron in scandium. The electronic configuration of scandium is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s2, 3d1. we can rearrange as below.

**Variation in Group**

In the periodic table, the atomic radius of elements increases down the group. As we move down a group, new shells are opened to accommodate the newly added valence electrons. As a result, the distance between the centre of the nucleus and the outermost shell containing the valence electron increases. Hence, the atomic radius increases. The trend in the variation of the atomic radius of the alkali metals down the group os shown below.

**3.5.2 Ionic radius**

It is defined as the distance from the centre of the nucleus of the ion up to which it exerts its influence on the electron cloud of the ion. Ionic radius of uni-univalent crystal can be calculated using Pauling's method from the inter ionic distance between the nuclei of the cation and anion. Pauling assumed  

that ions present in a crystal lattice are perfect spheres, and they are in contact with each other. Therefore,

d = rC+ + rA- ------------------ (1)

Where d is the distance between the centre of the nucleus of cation C+ and anion A- and rC+, rA- are the radius of the cation and anion respectively.

Pauling also assumed that the radius of the ion having noble gas electronic configuration (Na+ and Cl-

having 1s2 2s2, 2p⁶ configuration) is inversely proportional to the effective nuclear charge felt at the periphery of the ion.

**3.5.3 Ionisation energy**

It is defined as the minimum amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from the valence shell of the isolated neutral gaseous atom in its ground state. It is expressed in kJ mol-1 or in electron volts (eV).  

M(g) + IE1 → M+ (g) + 1 e-

Where IE1 represents the first ionisation energy.

**Successive Ionisation energies**

The minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from a unipositive cation is called second ionisation energy. It is represented by the following equation.

M+ (g) + IE2 → M2+

(g)+ 1 e-

In this way we can define the successive ionisation energies such as third, fourth etc.

The total number of electrons are less in the cation than the neutral atom while the nuclear charge remains the same. Therefore the effective nuclear charge of the cation is higher than the corresponding neutral atom. Thus the successive ionisation energies, always increase in the following order

IE1 < IE2 < IE3 < .....

**Periodic Trends in Ionisation Energy**

The ionisation energy usually increases along a period with few exceptions. As discussed earlier, when we move from left to right along a period, the valence electrons are added to the same shell, at the same time protons are added to the nucleus. This successive increase of nuclear charge increases the electrostatic attractive force on the valence electron and more energy is required to remove the valence electron resulting in high ionisation energy.

Let us consider the variation in ionisation energy of second period




  

elements. The plot of atomic number vs ionisation energy is given below.

In the following graph, there are two deviation in the trends of ionisiation energy. It is expected that boron has higher ionisation energy than beryllium since it has higher nuclear charge. However, the actual ionisation energies of beryllium and boron are 899 and 800 kJ mol-1 respectively contrary to the expectation. It is due to the fact that beryllium with completely filled 2s orbital, is more stable than partially filled valence shell electronic configuration of boron. (2s2

The electronic configuration of beryllium (Z=4) in its ground state is 1s2, 2s2 and that of boran is (Z = 5) 1s2 2s2 2p1

Similarly, nitrogen with 1s2, 2s2, 2p3 electronic configuration has higher ionisation energy (1402 kJ mol-1) than oxygen (1314 kJ mol-1). Since the half filled electronic configuration is more stable, it requires higher energy to remove an electron from 2p orbital of nitrogen. Whereas the removal one 2p electron from oxygen leads to a stable half filled  

configuration. This makes comparatively easier to remove 2p electron from oxygen.

**Periodic variation in group**

The ionisation energy decreases down a group. As we move down a group, the valence electron occupies new shells, the distance between the nucleus and the valence electron increases. So, the nuclear forces of attraction on valence electron decreases and hence ionisation energy also decreases down a group.

**Ionisation energy and shielding effect**

As we move down a group, the number of inner shell electron increases which in turn increases the repulsive force exerted by them on the valence electrons, i.e. the increased shielding effect caused by the inner electrons decreases the attractive force acting on the valence electron by the nucleus. Therefore the ionisation energy decreases.

Let us understand this trend by considering the ionisation energy of alkali metals.

**3.5.4 Electron Affinity**

It is defined as the amount of energy released (required in the case noble gases) when an electron is added to the valence shell of an isolated neutral gaseous atom in its ground state to form its anion. It is expressed in kJ mol-1

A + e- → A- + EA

**Variation of Electron Affinity in a period:**

The variation of electron affinity is not as systematic as in the case of ionisation energy. As we move from alkali metals to halogens in a period, generally electron affinity increases, i.e. the amount of energy released will be more. This is due to an increase in the nuclear charge and decrease in size of the atoms. However, in case of elements such as beryllium (1s2, 2s2), nitrogen (1s2, 2s2, 2p3) the addition of extra electron will disturb their stable electronic configuration and they have almost zero electron affinity.

Noble gases have stable ns2, np6 configuration, and the addition of further electron is unfavourable and requires energy. Halogens having the general electronic configuration of ns2, np5 readily accept an electron to get the stable noble gas electronic configuration (ns2, np6), and therefore in each period the halogen has high electron affinity. (high negative values)

**Variation of Electron affinity in a group:**

As we move down a group, generally the electron affinity decreases. It is due to increase in atomic size and the shielding effect of inner shell electrons. However, oxygen and fluorine have lower affinity than sulphur and chlorine respectively. The sizes of oxygen and fluorine atoms are comparatively small and they have high electron density. Moreover, the extra electron added to oxygen and fluorine has to be accommodated in the 2p orbital which is relatively compact compared to the 3p orbital of sulphur

and chlorine so, oxygen and fluorine have lower electron affinity than their respective group elements sulphur and chlorine.

**3.5.5 Electronegativity:**

It is defined as the relative tendency of an element present in a covalently bonded molecule, to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself.

Electronegativity is not a measurable quantity. However, a number of scales are available to calculate its value. One such method was developed by Pauling, he assigned arbitrary value of electronegativities for hydrogen and fluorine as 2.1 and 4.0 respectively. Based on this the electronegativity values for other elements can be calculated using the following expression

(χA – χB ) = 0.182 √EAB – (EAAxEBB)½  

Where EAB, EAA and EBB are the bond dissociation energies _(K cal)_ of AB, A2 and B2 molecules respectively.

The electronegativity of any given element is not a constant and its value depends on the element to which it is covalently bound. The electronegativity values play an important role in predicting the nature of the bond.

**Variation of Electronegativity in a period:**

The electronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right. As discussed earlier, the atomic radius decreases in a period, as the attraction between the valence electron and the nucleus increases. Hence the tendency to attract shared pair of electrons increases. Therefore, electronegativity also increases in a period

**Variation of Electronegativity in a group:** The electronegativity generally decreases down a group. As we move down a group the atomic radius increases and the nuclear attractive force on the valence electron decreases. Hence, the electronegativity decreases.

Noble gases are assigned zero electronegativity. The electronegativity values of the elements of s-block show the expected decreasing order in a group. Except 13th and 14th group all other p-block elements follow the expected decreasing trend in electronegativity.

**3.6 Periodic Trends in Chemical Properties:** So far, we have studied the periodicity of the physical properties such as atomic radius, ionisation enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. In addition, the chemical properties such as reactivity, valence, oxidation state etc… also show periodicity to certain extent.

In this section, we will discuss briefly about the periodicity in valence (oxidation state) and anomalous behaviour of second period elements (diagonal relationship).

**Valence or Oxidation States**

The valence of an atom is the combining capacity relative to hydrogen atom. It is usually equal to the total number of electrons in the valence shell or equal to eight minus the number of valence electrons. It is more convenient to use oxidation state in the place of valence.

**Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation States**

The valence of an atom primarily depends on the number of electrons in the

**Diagonal Relationship**

On moving diagonally across the periodic table, the second and third period elements show certain similarities. Even though the similarity is not same as we see in a group, it is quite pronounced in the following pair of elements.

Li Be B C

Na Mg Al Si

The similarity in properties existing between the diagonally placed elements is called ‘diagonal relationship’.

**3.6.2 Periodic Trends and Chemical Reactivity:**

The physical and chemical properties of elements depend on the valence shell electronic configuration as discussed earlier. The elements on the left side of the periodic table have less ionisation energy and readily lose their valence electrons. On the other hand, the elements on right side of the periodic table have high electron affinity and readily accept electrons. As a consequence of this, elements of these extreme ends show high reactivity when compared to the elements present in the middle. The noble gases having completely filled electronic configuration neither accept nor lose their electron readily and hence they are chemically inert in nature.

The ionisation energy is directly related to the metallic character and the elements located in the lower left portion of the periodic table have less ionisation energy and therefore show metallic  

character. On the other hand the elements located in the top right portion have very high ionisation energy and are non- metallic in nature.

Let us analyse the nature of the compounds formed by elements from both sides of the periodic table. Consider the reaction of alkali metals and halogens with oxygen to give the corresponding oxides.

4 Na + O2 → 2 Na2O

2 Cl2 + 7 O2 → 2 Cl2O7

Since sodium oxide reacts with water to give strong base sodium hydroxide, it is a basic oxide. Conversely Cl2O7 gives strong acid called perchloric acid upon reaction with water So, it is an acidic oxide.

Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH

Cl2O7 + H2O → 2 HClO4

Thus, the elements from the two extreme ends of the periodic table behave differently as expected.

As we move down the group, the ionisation energy decreases and the electropositive character of elements increases. Hence, the hydroxides of these elements become more basic. For example,let us consider the nature of the second group hydroxides:

Be(OH)2 amphoteric; Mg(OH)2 weakly basic; Ba(OH)2 strongly basic




  

Beryllium hydroxide reacts with both a

Be(OH)2 + 2HCl → BeCl2 + 2H2O

Be(OH)2 + 2 NaOH → Na2BeO2 + 2H2

**SUMM**

The periodic table was developed to systematically arrange the different elements. Lavoisier made the first attempt to arrange the known elements in a particular order based on properties. This followed by Johann Dobereiner, A. E. B. de Chancourtois and Newlands. First meaningful periodic table was constructed by Mendeleeve based on atomic mass. This was later modified based on the modern periodic law which states that the properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic numbers. The modern periodic table is made up of 18 groups and 7 periods.

The elements in the same groups have similar properties because their valence shell electronic configurations are similar. The properties of the elements of the same period differ because they have different valence shell electronic configurations. On the basis of electronic configuration the elements are also classified as s-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. The elements belonging to “s, p, d and f ” blocks have unique characteristic

properties. In this table, more than 78% of all known elements are metals. They appear on the left side of the periodic table. Non- metals are located at the top right hand side of the periodic table. Some elements show properties that are characteristic of both metals and non-metals and are called semi- metals or metalloids.

The periodic properties such as atomic radius, ionic radius, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy, electronegativity are possessing periodic trends. The variations of these properties are described in the following scheme.

The elements at the extreme left exhibit strong reducing property whereas the elements at extreme right strong oxidizing property. The reactivity of elements at the centre of the periodic table is low compared to elements at the extreme right and left.
