**1.1 Chemistry - the Centre of Life**

'Unna unavu, udukka udai, irukka idam' - in Tamil classical language means food to eat, cloth to wear and place to live. These are the three basic needs of human life. Chemistry plays a major role in providing these needs and also helps us to improve the quality of life. Chemistry has produced many compounds such as fertilizers, insecticides etc. that could enhance the agricultural production. We build better and stronger buildings that sustain different weather conditions with modern cements, concrete mixtures and better quality steel. We also have better quality fabrics.

Chemistry is everywhere in the world around us. Even our body is made up of chemicals. Continuous bio- chemical reactions occurring in our body are responsible for human activities. Chemistry touches almost every aspect of our lives, culture and environment. The world in which we are living is constantly changing, and the science of chemistry continues to expand and evolve to meet the challenges of our modern world. Chemical industries manufacture a broad range of new and useful materials that are used in every day life.

Examples : polymers, dyes, alloys, life saving drugs etc.

When HIV/AIDS epidemic began in early 1980s, patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But now many effective medicines are available to fight the  

infection, and people with HIV infection have longer and better life.

The understanding of chemical principles enabled us to replace the non eco friendly compounds such as CFCs in refrigerators with appropriate equivalents and increasing number of green processes. There are many researchers working in different fields of chemistry to develop new drugs, environment friendly materials, synthetic polymers etc. for the betterment of the society.

As chemistry plays an important role in our day-to-day life, it becomes essential to understand the basic principles of chemistry in order to address the mounting challenges in our developing country.

**1.2 Classification of Matter:**

Look around your classroom. What do you see? You might see your bench, table, blackboard, window etc. What are these things made of ? They are all made of matter. Matter is defined as anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter is composed of atoms. This knowledge of matter is useful to explain the experiences that we have with our surroundings. In order to understand the properties of matter better, we need to classify them. There are different ways to classify matter. The two most commonly used methods are classification by their physical state and by chemical composition as described in the chart.

**Fig. 1.1 Classification of Matter**

**1.2.1 Physical Classification of Matter :**

Matter can be classified as solids, liquids and gases based on their physical state. The physical state of matter can be converted into one another by modifying the temperature and pressure suitably.

**1.2.2 Chemical Classification :**

Matter can be classified into mixtures and pure substances based on chemical compositions. Mixtures consist of more than one chemical entity present without any chemical interactions. They can be further classified as homogeneous  

or heterogeneous mixtures based on their physical appearance.

Pure substances are composed of simple atoms or molecules. They are further classified as elements and compounds.

**Element :**

An element consists of only one type of atom. We know that an atom is the smallest electrically neutral particle, being made up of fundamental particles, namely electrons, protons and neutrons.

Element can exist as monatomic or polyatomic units.

Example : **Monatomic unit -** Gold (Au), Copper (Cu); **Polyatomic unit -** Hydrogen (H2), Phosphorous (P4) and Sulphur (S8)

**Compound:**

Compounds are made up of molecules which contain two or more atoms of different elements.

Example : Carbon dioxide (CO2), Glucose (C6H12O6), Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S), Sodium Chloride (NaCl)

Properties of compounds are different from those of their constituent elements. For example, sodium is a shiny metal, and chlorine is an irritating gas. But the compound formed from these two elements, sodium chloride, shows different characteristics as it is a crystalline solid, vital for biological functions.

**1.3 Atomic and Molecular Masses**

**1.3.1 Atomic Masses**

How much does an individual atom weigh? As atoms are too small with diameter of 10–10 m and weigh approximately 10–27 kg, it is not possible to measure their mass directly. Hence it is proposed to have relative scale based on a standard atom.

The C-12 atom is considered as standard by the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), and its mass is fixed as 12 amu (or) u. The amu (or) unified atomic mass unit is defined as one twelfth of the mass of a Carbon-12 atom in its ground state.

i.e. 1 amu (or) 1u ≈ 1.6605 × 10–27 kg.

In this scale, the relative atomic mass is defined as the ratio of the average atomic mass to the unified atomic mass unit.  

Relative atomic mass (Ar)

\= Average mass of the atom

Unified atomic mass

**For example,**

Relative atomic mass of hydrogen (Ar)H

\= Average mass of H-atom (in kg)

1.6605 × 10–27 kg

\= 1.6736 × 10–27 kg

1.6605 × 10–27 kg

\= 1.0078 ≈ 1.008 u.

Since most of the elements consist of isotopes that differ in mass, we use average atomic mass. Average atomic mass is defined as the average of the atomic masses of all atoms in their naturally occurring isotopes. For example, chlorine consists of two naturally occurring isotopes 17Cl35 and 17Cl37 in the ratio 77 : 23, the average relative atomic mass of chlorine is

\= (35 × 77) + (37 × 23)

100 = 35.46 u

**1.3.2 Molecular Mass**

Similar to relative atomic mass, relative molecular mass is defined as the ratio of the mass of a molecule to the unified atomic mass unit. The relative molecular mass of any compound can be calculated by adding the relative atomic masses of its constituent atoms.

**For example,**

i) Relative molecular mass of hydrogen molecule (H2)




  

\= 2 × (relative atomic mass of hydrogen atom)

\= 2 × 1.008 u

\= 2.016 u.

ii) Relative molecular mass of glucose (C6H12O6)

\= (6 × 12) + ( 12 ×1.008) + (6 ×16)

\= 72+12.096+96

\= 180.096 u

(ii) Potassium permanganate (KMnO4)

(iii) Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)

(iv) Sucrose (C12H22O11)

**1.4 Mole Concept**

Often we use special names to express the quantity of individual items for our convenience. For example, a dozen  

roses means 12 roses and one quire paper means 24 single sheets. We can extend this analogy to understand the concept of mole that is used for quantifying atoms and molecules in chemistry. Mole is the SI unit to represent a specific amount of a substance.

To understand the mole concept, let us calculate the total number of atoms present in 12 g of carbon -12 isotope or molecules in 158.03 g of potassium permanganate, 294.18 g of potassium dichromate and 180 g of glucose.

**Gastric acid and antacids:**

Antacids are commonly used medicines for treating heartburn and acidity. Do

you know the chemistry behind it?

Gastric acid is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and it contains hydrochloric acid. The typical concentration of the acid in gastric acid is 0.082 M. When the concentration exceeds 0.1 M it causes the heartburn and acidity.

Antacids used to treat acidity contain mostly magnesium hydroxide or aluminium hydroxide that neutralises the excess acid. The chemical reactions are as follows.

3 HCl + Al(OH)3→ AlCl3 + 3 H2O

2 HCl + Mg(OH)2→MgCl2 + 2 H2O

From the above reactions we know that 1 mole of aluminium hydroxide neutralises 3 moles of HCl while 1 mole of magnesium hydroxide neutralises 2 moles of HCl.

**1.4.1 Avogadro Number:**

The total number of entities present in one mole of any substance is equal to 6.022 x 1023. This number is called Avogadro number which is named after the Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro who proposed that equal volume of all gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal number of molecules. Avogadro number does not have any unit.

In a chemical reaction, atoms or molecules react in a specific ratio. Let us consider the following examples

Reaction 1 : C + O2→ CO2

Reaction 2 : CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O In the first reaction, one carbon atom reacts with one oxygen molecule to give one carbon dioxide molecule. In the second reaction, one molecule of methane burns with two molecules of oxygen to give one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water. It is clear that the ratio of reactants is based on the number of molecules. Even though the ratio is based on the number of molecules it is practically difficult to count the number of

Let us calculate the amount of acid neutralised by an antacid that contains 250 mg of aluminium hydroxide and 250 mg of magnesium hydroxide.

Acidity & Heart burn

He is known for the Avogadro's hypothesis. In honour of his contributions, the number of fundamental particles in a mole of substance was named as Avogadro number. Though Avogadro didn't predict the number of particles in equal volumes of gas, his hypothesis did lead to the eventual determination of the number as 6.022 x 1023 Rudolf Clausius, with his kinetic theory of gases, provided evidence for Avogadro's law.

molecules. Because of this reason it is beneficial to use **'mole'** concept rather than the actual number of molecules to quantify the reactants and the products. We can explain the first reaction as one mole of carbon reacts with one mole of oxygen to give one mole of carbon dioxide and the second reaction as one mole of methane burns with two moles of oxygen to give one mole of carbon dioxide and two moles of water. When only atoms are involved, scientists also use the term one gram atom instead of one mole.

**1.4.2 Molar Mass:**

Molar mass is defined as the mass of one mole of a substance. The molar mass of a compound is equal to the sum of the relative atomic masses of its constituents expressed in g mol-1.

**Examples:** • relative atomic mass of one hydrogen

atom = 1.008 u • molar mass of hydrogen atom

\= 1.008 g mol-1

• relative molecular mass of glucose = 180 u

• molar mass of glucose = 180 g mol-1

**1.4.3 Molar Volume:**

The volume occupied by one mole of any substance in the gaseous state at a given temperature and pressure is called molar volume.

Conditions

273 K and 1 bar pressure (STP) 22.71

3b) Calculate the number of molecules of oxygen gas that occupies a volume of 224 ml at 273 K and 3 atm pressure.  

**1.5 Gram Equivalent Concept:**

Similar to mole concept gram equivalent concept is also widely used in chemistry especially in analytical chemistry. In the previous section, we have understood that mole concept is based on molecular mass. Similarly gram equivalent concept is based on equivalent mass.

**Definition:**

Gram equivalent mass is defined as the mass of an element (compound or ion) that combines or displaces 1.008 g hydrogen or 8 g oxygen or 35.5 g chlorine.

Consider the following reaction:

Zn+H2SO4 → ZnSO4+H2

In this reaction 1 mole of zinc (i.e. 65.38 g) displaces one mole of hydrogen molecule (2.016 g).

Mass of zinc required to displace 1.008 g hydrogen is

\= 65.38

× 1.008 2.016

\= 65.38

2

The equivalent mass of zinc = 32.69

The gram equivalent mass of zinc = 32.69 g eq-1

Equivalent mass has no unit but gram equivalent mass has the unit g eq-1

It is not always possible to apply the above mentioned definition which is

require the same. We prefer to use mole concept for non-redox reactions and gram equivalent concept for redox reactions.

**For example,**

If we know the equivalent mass of KMnO4 and anhydrous ferrous sulphate, without writing balanced chemical reaction we can straightaway say that 31.6 g of KMnO4 reacts with 152 g of FeSO4 using gram equivalent concept.

The same can also be explained on the basis of mole concept. The balanced chemical equation for the above mentioned reaction is

10 FeSO4 + 2 KMnO4 + 8 H2SO4 ↓

K2SO4 + 2 MnSO4 + 5 Fe2(SO4)3 + 8H2O

i.e. 2 moles (2 × 158 = 316 g) of potassium permanganate reacts with 10 moles (10 × 152 = 1520 g) of anhydrous ferrous sulphate.

∴ 31.6 g KMnO4 reacts with

1520 316

**1.6 Empirical Formula and Molecular Formula**

Elemental analysis of a compound gives the mass percentage of atoms present in the compound. Using the mass percentage, we can determine the empirical formula of the compound. Molecular formula of the compound can be arrived at from the empirical formula using the molar mass of the compound.

Empirical formula of a compound is the formula written with the simplest ratio of the number of different atoms present in one molecule of the compound as subscript to the atomic symbol. Molecular formula of a compound is the formula written with the actual number of different atoms present in one molecule as a subscript to the atomic symbol.

Let us understand the empirical formula by considering acetic acid as an example.

The molecular formula of acetic acid is C2H4O2

The ratio of C : H : O is 1 : 2 : 1 and hence the empirical formula is CH2O.

**1.6.1 Determination of Empirical Formula from Elemental Analysis Data :**

**Step 1:** Since the composition is expressed in percentage, we can consider the total mass of the compound as 100 g and the percentage values of individual elements as mass in grams.




  

**Step 2:** Divide the mass of each element by its atomic mass. This gives the relative number of moles of various elements in the compound.

**Step 3:** Divide the value of relative number of moles obtained in the step 2 by the smallest number of them to get the simplest ratio.

**Step 4:** (only if necessary) in case the simplest ratios obtained in the step 3 are not whole numbers then they may be converted into whole number by multiplying by a suitable smallest number.

**Example:**

1\. An acid found in Tamarind on analysis shows the following percentage composition: 32 % Carbon; 4 % Hydrogen; 64 % Oxygen. Find the empirical formula of the compound.

Alternatively, we can calculate the amount of kesari obtained from 3 cups rava as below.

Similarly, we can calculate the required quantity of other ingredients too.

We can extend this concept to perform stoichiometric calculations for a chemical reaction. In Greek, _stoicheion_ means element and _metron_ means measure that is, **stoichiometry gives the numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a balanced chemical equation**. By applying the concept of stoichiometry, we can calculate the amount of reactants required to prepare a specific amount of a product and vice versa using balanced chemical equation.

Let us consider the following chemical reaction.

C(s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g)

From this equation, we learnt that 1 mole of carbon reacts with 1 mole of oxygen molecule to form 1 mole of carbon dioxide.

1 mole of C ≡ 1 mole of O2

≡ 1 mole of CO2

**Calculations based on Stoichiometry**

1\. How many moles of hydrogen is required to produce 10 moles of ammonia ?

The balanced stoichiometric equation for the formation of ammonia is

N2(g) + 3 H2 (g) → 2 NH3 (g)

As per the stoichiometric equation,

to produce 2 moles of ammonia, 3 moles of hydrogen are required

∴ to produce 10 moles of ammonia,

3 moles of H2 2 moles of NH3

× 10 moles of NH3

\= 15 moles of hydrogen are required.

2\. Calculate the amount of water produced by the combustion of 32 g of methane.

CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)

As per the stoichiometric equation,

Combustion of 1 mole (16 g) CH4 produces 2 moles (2 × 18 = 36 g) of water.

CH4

(12) + (4 ×1) = 16 g mol–1

H2O

(2×1) + (1 ×16) = 18 g mol–1

Combustion of 32 g CH4 produces  

36 g H2O

16 g CH4

2 = 72 g of water

3\. How much volume of carbon dioxide is produced when 50 g of calcium carbonate is heated completely under standard conditions?

The balanced chemical equation is,

CaCO3 (s) CaO(s) + CO2 (g)

As per the stoichiometric equation,

1 mole (100g) CaCO3 on heating produces 1 mole CO2

CaCO3

(40) + (12) + (3 × 16) = 100 g mol–1

At STP, 1 mole of CO2 occupies a volume of 22.7 litres

∴ At STP, 50 g of CaCO3 on heating produces,

22.7 litres _of CO2_ 100g CaCO3

× 50 g CaCO3

2 = 11.35 litres of CO2

4\. How much volume of chlorine is required to form 11.2 L of HCl at 273 K and 1 atm pressure ?

As per the stoichiometric equation,

under given conditions,

Δ







  

To produce 2 moles of HCl, 1 mole of chlorine gas is required

To produce 44.8 litres of HCl, 22.4 litres of chlorine gas are required.

∴ To produce 11.2 litres of HCl,

22.4 L Cl2 44.8 L of HCl

× 11.2 L of HCl

4

\= 5.6 litres of chlorine are required.

5\. Calculate the percentage composition of the elements present in magnesium carbonate. How many kilogram of CO2 can be obtained by heating 1 kg of 90 % pure magnesium carbonate.

The balanced chemical equation is

MgCO3 MgO + CO2 ∆

Molar mass of MgCO3 is 84 g mol–1.

84 g MgCO3 contain 24 g of Magnesium.

∴ 100 g of MgCO3 contain

24 g Mg 84 g MgCO3

× 100 g MgCO3

\= 28.57 g Mg.

i.e. percentage of magnesium

\= 28.57 %.

84 g MgCO3 contain 12 g of carbon

1.19  

MgCO3

(24) + (12) + (3 × 16) = 84 g mol–1

∴ 100 g MgCO3 contain

12 g C 84 g MgCO3

× 100 g MgCO3

\= 14.29 g of carbon.

∴ Percentage of carbon

\= 14.29 %.

84 g MgCO3 contain 48 g of oxygen

∴ 100 g MgCO3 contains

48 g O 84 g MgCO3

× 100 g MgCO3

\= 57.14 g of oxygen.

∴ Percentage of oxygen

\= 57.14 %.

As per the stoichiometric equation,

84 g of 100 % pure MgCO3 on heating gives 44 g of CO2.

∴ 1000 g of 90 % pure MgCO3 gives

\= 44 g 84 g × 100 %

× 90 % × 1000 g

\= 471.43 g of CO2

**1.7.2 Limiting Reagents:**

Earlier, we learnt that the stoichiometry concept is useful in predicting the amount of product formed in a given chemical reaction. If the reaction is carried out with stoichiometric quantities of reactants, then all the reactants will be converted into products. On the other hand, when a reaction is carried out using non-stoichiometric quantities of the reactants, the product yield will be determined by the reactant that is completely consumed. It limits the further reaction from taking place and is called as the limiting reagent. The other reagents which are in excess are called the excess reagents.

Recall the analogy that we used in stoichiometry concept i.e. kesari preparation,

As per the recipe requirement, 2 cups of sugar are needed for every cup of rava. Consider a situation where 8 cups of sugar and 3 cups of rava are available (all other ingredients are in excess), as per the cooking recipe, we require 3 cups of rava and 6 cups of sugar to prepare 18 cups of kesari. Even though we have 2 more cups of sugar left, we cannot make any more quantity of Kesari as there is no rava available and hence rava limits the quantity of Kesari in this case. Extending this analogy for the chemical reaction in which three moles of sulphur are allowed to react with twelve moles of fluorine to give sulfur hexafluoride.

The balanced equation for this reaction is, S + 3F2 → SF6  

?**Evaluate Yourself**

7) The balanced equation for a reaction is given below

When 8 moles of x react with 15 moles of y, then

i) Which is the limiting reagent?

ii) Calculate the amount of products formed.

iii) Calculate the amount of excess reactant left at the end of the reaction.

As per the stoichiometry,

1 mole of sulphur reacts with 3 moles of fluorine to form 1 mole of sulphur hexafluoride and therefore 3 moles of sulphur reacts with 9 moles of fluorine to form 3 moles of sulphur hexafluoride. In this case, all available sulphur gets consumed and therefore it limits the further reaction. Hence sulphur is the limiting reagent and fluorine is the excess reagent. The remaining three moles of fluorine are in excess and do not react.

Urea, a commonly used nitrogen based fertilizer, is prepared by the reaction between ammonia and carbon dioxide as follows.

2) Calculate the quantity of urea formed and unreacted quantity of the excess reagent.

**1.8 Redox Reactions**

When an apple is cut, it turns brown after sometime. Do you know the reason behind this colour change? It is because of a chemical reaction called oxidation. We come across oxidation reactions in our daily life. For example 1) burning of LPG gas 2) rusting of iron

**Fig. 1.4 Oxidation reactions in daily life**

Even a small amount of oxygen present in air leads to the rusting of iron, i.e. iron is oxidised to Fe3+.

But the Fe2+ present in haemoglobin which binds oxygen during transport of oxygen from lungs to tissues never gets oxidised. Do you know why?

The answer lies in the structural features of haemoglobin. Haemoglobin contains four sub units each with a porphyrin ring (heme) attached to the protein (globin) molecule. In this structure, the iron (Fe2+) forms a co-ordination complex with an octahedral geometry. The four positions of the octahedron are occupied by porphyrin rings, fifth position is filled by imidazole ring of a histidine residue and the sixth position is utilized for binding the oxygen molecule. Generally the Fe2+ in heme is susceptible to oxidation. Since the Fe2+ ion in haemoglobin is surrounded by the globin protein chain that provides a hydrophobic environment, the oxidation of Fe2+ becomes difficult. However, 3% of haemoglobin is oxidised to methemoglobin (haemoglobin where the iron is present in Fe3+ state and oxygen does not bind to this) daily. The enzyme methemoglobin reductase reduces it back to haemoglobin.

**Haemoglobin and**  

3) Oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids, etc. into CO2 and H2O to produce energy in the living organisms.

All oxidation reactions are accompanied by reduction reactions and vice versa. Such reactions are called redox reactions. As per the classical concept, addition of oxygen (or) removal of hydrogen is called oxidation and the reverse is called reduction.

**Cyanide poisoning**: While oxygen binds reversibly to haemoglobin, cyanide binds irreversibly to haemoglobin and blocks oxygen binding. As a result the transport of oxygen from the lungs to tissues is stopped. It leads to the quick death of the person.

**oxygen transport**




  

Consider the following two reactions.

Reaction 1 : 4 Fe + 3O2 → 2 Fe2O3

Reaction 2 : H2S + Cl2 → 2 HCl + S

Both these reactions are oxidation reactions as per the classical concept.

In the first reaction which is responsible for the rusting of iron, the oxygen adds on to the metal, iron. In the second reaction, hydrogen is removed from Hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Identity which species gets reduced.

Consider the following two reactions in which the removal of oxygen and addition of hydrogen take place respectively. These reactions are called reduction reactions as per the classical concept.

CuO + C → Cu + CO (Removal of oxygen from cupric oxide)

S + H2 → H2S (Addition of hydrogen to sulphur).

Oxidation-reduction reactions i.e. redox reactions are not always associated with oxygen or hydrogen. In such cases, the process can be explained on the basis of electrons. The reaction involving loss of electron is termed oxidation and gain of electron is termed reduction.

**For example,**

Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e– (loss of electron-oxidation).

Cu2++ 2e– → Cu (gain of electron-reduction)

Redox reactions can be better explained using oxidation numbers.  

**1.8.1 Oxidation Number:**

It is defined as the imaginary charge left on the atom when all other atoms of the compound have been removed in their usual oxidation states that are assigned according to set of rules. A term that is often used interchangeably with oxidation number is oxidation state

1) The oxidation state of a free element (i.e. in its uncombined state) is zero.

**Example :** each atom in H2, Cl2, Na, S8 have the oxidation number of zero.

2) For a monatomic ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion.

**Example : The oxidation number of sodium** in Na+ is +1.

The oxidation number of chlorine in Cl– is –1.

3) The algebric sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a molecule is equal to zero, while in ions, it is equal to the net charge on the ion.

**Example:**

In H2SO4 ; 2 × (oxidation number of hydrogen) + (oxidation number of S) + 4 (oxidation number of oxygen) = 0.

In SO4 2– ; (oxidation number of S) + 4

(oxidation number of oxygen) = –2.

4) Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 in all its compounds except in metal hydrides where it has –1 value.

**Redox reactions in terms of oxidation numb**

During redox reactions, the oxidation which oxidation number of the element incre it decreases is called reduction.

Consider the following reaction

2 KMnO4 + 10FeSO4 + 8H2SO4 K + 7 + 2

In this reaction, manganese in potas oxidation of ferrous sulphate (FeSO4) into fer and thereby gets reduced. Such reagents are c , the reagents which facilitate reduction by re reducing agents.

In some redox reactions, the same compound can undergo both oxidation and reduction. In such reactions, the oxidation state of one and the same element is both increased and decreased. These reactions are called disproportionation reactions.

**Examples:**

2H2O2 2H2O + O2

**5\. Competitive electron transfer reaction**

In metal displacement reactions, we learnt that zinc replaces copper from copper sulphate solution. Let us examine whether the reverse reaction takes place or not. As discussed earlier, place a metallic copper strip in zinc sulphate solution. If copper replaces zinc from zinc sulphate solution, Cu2+ ions would be released into the solution and the colour of the solution




  

would change to blue. But no such change is observed. Therefore, we conclude that among zinc and copper, zinc has more tendency to release electrons and copper to accept the electrons.

Let us extend the reaction to copper metal and silver nitrate solution. Place a strip of metallic copper in sliver nitrate solution taken in a beaker. After some time, the solution slowly turns blue. This is due to the formation of Cu2+ ions, i.e. copper replaces silver from silver nitrate. The reaction is,

Cu(s) + 2AgNO3 (aq) Cu(NO3)2 (aq) +2Ag (s) +20 0+1

Oxidation

Reduction

It indicates that between copper and silver, copper has the tendency to release electrons and silver to accept electrons.

From the above experimental observations, we can conclude that among the three metals, namely, zinc, copper and silver, the electron releasing tendency is in the following order.

**Zinc > Copper > Silver**  

This kind of competition for electrons among various metals helps us to design (galvanic) cells. In XII standard we will study the galvanic cell in detail.

**1.8.3. Balancing (the Equation) of Redox Reactions**

The two methods for balancing the equation of redox reactions are as follows.

i) The oxidation number method

ii) Ion-electron method / half reaction method.

Both are based on the same principle: In oxidation - reduction reactions the total number of electrons donated by the reducing agent is equal to the total number of electrons gained by the oxidising agent.

**Oxidation number method**

In this method, the number of electrons lost or gained in the reaction is calculated from the oxidation numbers of elements before and after the reaction. Let us consider the oxidation of ferrous sulphate by potassium permanganate in acid medium. The unbalanced chemical equation is,

FeSO4 + KMnO4+H2SO4→Fe2(SO4)3 +

MnSO4+ K2SO4+H2O

**Step 1**

Using oxidation number concept, identify the reactants (atom) which undergo oxidation and reduction.




  

FeSO4 + KMnO4+H2SO4→Fe2 (SO4)3 +2 +7 +3

Reduction

Oxidation

\+ MnSO4+ K2SO4+H2O +2

a) The oxidation number of Mn in KMnO4 changes from +7 to +2 by gaining five electrons.

b) The oxidation number of Fe in FeSO4 changes from +2 to +3 by loosing one electron.

**Step 2**

Since, the total number of electrons lost is equal to the total number of electrons gained, equate, the number of electrons, by cross multiplication of the respective formula with suitable integers on reactant side as below. Here, the product Fe2(SO4)3 contains 2 moles of iron, So, the Coefficients 1e- & 5e- are multiplied by the number '2'

FeSO4 + KMnO4+H2SO4→ Fe2(SO4)3 +2 +7 +3

5e- × 21e- × 2

102

\+ MnSO4

\+ K2SO4+H2O

+2

10 FeSO4+2 KMnO4+H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 +

MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O

**Step 3 Balance the reactant / Product - Oxidised / reduced**

Now, based on the reactant side, balance the products (ie oxidised and reduced).The above equation becomes  

10FeSO4+2KMnO4+H2SO4 → 5Fe2(SO4)3 + 2MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O

**Step 4** Balance the other elements except H and O atoms. In this case, we have to balance K and S atoms but K is balanced automatically.

Reactant Side : 10 'S' atoms (10 FeSO4)

Product Side : 18 'S' atoms

5Fe2(SO4)3 + 2MnSO4 + K2SO4

15S 1S2S =+ + 18S

Therefore the difference 8-S atoms in reactant side, has to be balanced by multiplying H2SO4 by '8' The equation now becomes,

10FeSO4+2KMnO4+8H2SO4 →5Fe2(SO4)3

\+ 2MnSO4 + K2SO4 + H2O

**Step 5**

Balancing 'H' and 'O' atoms

Reactant side '16'-H atoms (8H2SO4 i.e. 8 x 2H = 16 'H')

Product side '2' - H atoms (H2O i.e. 1 x 2H = 2 'H')

Therefore, multiply H2O molecules in the product side by '8'

10 FeSO4+2 KMnO4+8 H2SO4 →

5 Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 MnSO4 + K2SO4 + 8H**2**O

The oxygen atom is automatically balanced. This is the balanced equation.

**Ion - Electron method** This method is used for ionic redox reactions. **Step 1** Using oxidation number concept, find out the reactants which undergo oxidation and reduction. **Step 2**

Write two separate half equations for oxidation and reduction reaction,

Let us consider the same example which we have already discussed in oxidation number method.

KMnO4 +FeSO4 + H2SO4 →

MnSO4+Fe2(SO4)3 + K2SO4+H2O

The ionic form of this reaction is,

?**Evaluate Yourself**

8) Balance the following equation using o

As2S3 + HNO3 + H2O → H  

The two half reactions are,

Fe2+ → Fe3+ + 1e- ------------------------ (1) and

MnO− 4 + 5e- → Mn2+ -------------------- (2)

Balance the atoms and charges on both sides of the half reactions.

Equation (1)⇒ No changes i.e.,

Fe2+→ Fe3+ + 1e- ------------------------- (1)

Equation (2)⇒ 4'O' on the reactant side, therefore add 4H2O on the product side, to balance 'H' - add, 8H+ in the reactant side

MnO− 4 + 5e- + 8H+ → Mn2+ + 4H2O---- (3)

**Step 3**

Equate both half reactions such that the number of electrons lost is equal to number of electrons gained.

Addition of two half reactions gives the balanced equation represented by equation (6).

**SUMM**

Chemistry plays a major role in providing needs of human life in our day- to-day life. All things that we come across in life are made of matter. Anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter. Matter is classified based on the physical state and by chemical composition. An element consists of only one type of atom. Compounds contain two or more atoms of same or different elements and their properties are different from those of its constituent elements.

Atoms are too small to measure their masses directly. The IUPAC introduced relative scale of mass based on a standard atom C-12. One twelfth of the mass of a Carbon-12 atom in its ground state is called as Unified atomic mass. 1 amu (or) 1u ≈ 1.6605 × 10–27 kg. Relative atomic mass is defined as the ratio of the average atomic mass to the unified atomic mass unit. Average atomic mass of an element is the average of the atomic masses of all its naturally occurring isotopes. Molecular mass is the ratio of the mass of a molecule to the unified atomic mass unit. Relative molecular mass is obtained by adding the relative atomic masses of its constituent atoms.

Amounts of substances are usually expressed in moles. A mole is the amount of substance which contains as many elementary entities as there are in 12 gram of Carbon- 12 isotope. Avogadro number is the total number of entities present in one mole of any substance and is equal to 6.022 x 1023. Molar mass is the mass of one mole of that substance expressed in  

**ARY**

g mol-1. One mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 litre at 273 K and 1 atm pressure. Similar to the mole concept, the concept of equivalent mass is also used in analytical chemistry. Gram equivalent mass is the mass of an element (compound/ ion) that combines or displaces 1.008 g hydrogen, 8 g oxygen or 35.5 g chlorine. Elemental analysis of a compound gives the mass percentage of atoms from which empirical and molecular formula are calculated. Empirical formula is the simplest ratio of the number of different atoms present in one molecule of the compound. Molecular formula is the formula written with the actual number of different atoms present in one molecule. A quantitative relationship between reactants and products can be understood from stoichiometry. Stoichiometry gives the numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a balanced equation. When a reaction is carried out using non- stoichiometric quantities of the reactants, the product yield will be determined by the reactant that is completely consumed and is called the limiting reagent. It limits the further reaction to take place. The other reagent which is in excess is called the excess reagent.

The reaction involving loss of electron is oxidation and gain of electron is reduction. Usually both these reactions take place simultaneously and are called as redox reactions. These redox reactions can be explained using oxidation number concept. Oxidation number is the imaginary charge left on the atom when all other atoms of the compound have




  

been removed in their usual oxidation states the element increases is called oxidation and

**Redox reactions in which**

• two substances combine to form compoun

• a compound breaks down into two (or) reaction

• an ion (or atom) in a compound is replace called displacement reactions

• the same compound can undergo both oxi of one and the same element is both incre reactions.

• competition for electrons occurs between transfer reactions.
