**Friedrich Wöhler,** was a German pioneer in organic chemistry. He is best known for his synthesis of urea an the organic compound from the inorganic compound, ammonium cyanate. This finding went against the mainstream theory of that time called _vitalism_ which stated that organic matter possessed a special force or vital force inherent to all living things. He is also the first to isolate several chemical elements. He is the discoverer of the element aluminum and also the co-discoverer of yttrium, beryllium, and titanium.

**11.1 Introduction**

rganic chemistry is the study of compounds n. Carbon has a tendency to form more ds with itself and other atoms (H, O, N, S

gens) than any other elements. The tendency m to form a chain of bonds with the atoms me element is called catenation. The high of C-C bond is responsible for its catenation .

e word 'organic' means 'derived from living s'. Organic compounds were thought to be ly in living things. Cell the basic unit of living onsumes, creates and consists of mainly ompounds. DNA, the genetic material, the

lipids, that forms our cell membrane and the glycogen the energy reserve stored in our liver are all organic compounds. Except few inorganic compounds like salt, water etc... all others such as food, medicine, clothing, cosmetics, fuel etc... are compounds of carbon. All the essential biochemical reactions are also organic in nature leading to the fomation of various essential bioorganic molecules such as lipoproteins, phospholipids, glycolipids etc...

Synthesis of acetic acid by kolbe and methane by Berthlot, confirmed that organic compounds can be synthesized in laboratory. Since then, millions of organic compounds were synthesised and characterised. The field of organic chemistry is very vast and its principles find applications in many industries including food, textile, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, dye, polymers, fertilizer, cosmetics etc... Discussing the importance of organic chemistry is just like describing a drop of water in a mighty ocean.

The knowledge of chemical bonding and molecular structure will help in understanding the properties of organic compounds. We know that, the carbon has four valance electrons and its ground state electronic configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p2. An atom can attain noble gas electronic configuration either by transferring or sharing of electrons. It is not possible for the carbon to form either C4+ or C4- ions to attain the nearest noble gas configuration, as it requires large amount of energy. This implies that carbon cannot form ionic bond. Almost in all compounds of carbon, it forms four covalent bonds.  

The formation of four covalent bonds can be explained as below. During bond formation, one of the electrons from 2s orbital is promoted to 2pz orbital. The formation of four sigma bonds by carbon can be explained on the basis of sp3 hybridisation of carbon. Carbon forms multiple (double and triple) bonds in certain compounds. These can be explained by sp2 and sp hybridisation of carbon. The carbon forms relatively short bonds which enable the lateral overlap of unhybridised 2p orbitals of sp2 and sp hybridised carbon to form one and two pi bonds respectively.

Molecular stucture can be derived from the type of hybridisation. An sp3 hybridised carbon will have a tetrahedral geometry, a sp2 hybridised carbon will have trigonal planar geometry. and sp hybridised carbon will have a linear geometry.

**Characteristics of organic compounds:**

All organic compounds have the following characteristic properties.

1\. They are covalent compounds of carbon and generally insoluble in water and readily soluble in organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, ether, chloroform etc...

2\. Many of the organic compounds are inflammable (except CCl4).They possess low boiling and melting points due to their covalent nature

3\. Organic compounds are characterised by functional groups. A functional group is an atom or a specific combination of bonded atoms that




  

react in a characteristic way, irrespecti present. In almost all the cases, the react the functional group. They exhibit isome

4\. **Homologous series:** A series of organic functional group and the successive me formula by a CH2 group is called homolog

**Alkanes:** Methane (CH4), Ethane (C2H6),

**Alcohols:** Methanol (CH3OH), Ethanol (

Compounds of the homologous series ar CnH2n+2, Alkenes CnH2n, Alkynes CnH2n-2 an show regular gradation in physical properti

**11.3 Nomenclature of organic compounds:**

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is the world authority on chemical nomenclature and terminology, naming of new elements in the periodic table standardized methods  

for measurement; atomic weights, and many other critically-evaluated data. According to IUPAC recommendations to name any organic compound, it is considered as a derivative of its parent saturated hydrocarbon. The IUPAC name of an organic compound consists of three parts.

**prefix + root word + suffix**

Root word denotes the number of carbon atoms in the longest continiuous chain in molecules. Prefix denotes the group(s) attached to the main chain which is placed before the root. Suffix denotes the funtional group and is placed after the root word.

**The following are guide lines for writing** 1\. The IUPAC names are always written as si

salts, acids and acid derivatives.

2\. Commas are used between two adjacent used to separate numbers and letter symb **N,N-Dimethyl methanamide**

3\. Structural prefix such as, meso-, cis-, tran hypen. These prefixes are omitted in alpha names at the beginning of a sentence.**Eg:**

4 .Structural prefixes such as di, tri, tetra therefore are neither italicised nor separa into account in alphabetising compound

5 To name alicyclic compounds , the addit in the table 11.6

**Table 11.6 Rules for naming of alicyclic c**

**Rule**

In the naming of such compounds a prefix cyclo is added to the word root

If only one substituent is present on the ring, then it is not required to give its position

If two or more substituents are present on the ring, the numbering of ring is done according to lowest set of locant rule. Alicyclic compounds also follow the numbering rules of acyclic compounds

**2**  

**IUPAC of the organic compound.** ngle word, with notable exception of organic

number or letter symbols, and hypens are ol in names **Eg: 2,2-Dimethyl-3-hexene**

s-, are italicised and joined to the name by a betising compound names or in capitalising

**_trans_\-2-Butene**

are treated as a part of the basic name and ted by a hypen. These prefixes are not taken names **eg: 4- Ethyl -2,2-dimethyl hexane.**

ional rules should be followed as illustrated

**Rule**

If both alicyclic ring and the side chain contain same functional group, the parent hydrocarbon is selected on the basis of number of carbon- atoms in the ring and side chain

If more than one alicyclic rings are attached to the single chain of carbon atoms, the compound is named as a derivative of alkane and alicyclic rings are treated as substituent irrespective of the number of atom in the ring or chain

If the alicyclic ring is directly attached to the benzene ring the compound is named as a derivative of benzene

If the alicyclic ring has a functional group along with some substituent on the ring, then the appropriate prefixes and suffixes are used to represent such groups, and numbering is done in such a way that the functional group is not counted for word root rather appropriate suffixes are used to represent such groups

**11.4 Structural representation of organic compounds**

Molecular formula of a compound is the simplest, least informative representation, showing the ratio of atoms present. The structure of an organic compound can be represented using any one of the below mentioned methods.

1\. Lewis structure or dot structure,

2\. Dash structure or line bond structure,

3\. Condensed structure

4\. Bond line structure

We know how to draw the Lewis structure for a molecule. The line bond structure is obtained by representing the two electron covalent bond by a dash or line (-) in a Lewis structure. A single line or dash represents single σ covalent bond, double line represents double bond (1σ bond, 1π bond) and a triple line represents

triple bond (1σ bond, 2π bond). Lone pair of electrons on heteroatoms may or may not be shown. This represents the complete structural formula.

This structural formula can be further abbreviated by omitting some or all of the dashes representing covalent bonds and by indicating the number of identical groups attached to an atom by a subscript. The resulting expression of the compound is called a condensed structural formula.

For further simplification, organic chemists use another way of representing the structures in which only lines are used. In this type of representation of organic compounds, carbon and hydrogen atoms are not shown and the lines representing carbon-carbon bonds are shown in a zigzag fashion. The only atoms specifically written are oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen etc. These representations can be easily understood by the following illustration.

This is a method of representing three dimensional structures in two dimension. In this method, the chiral atom(s) lies in the plane of paper. The horizontal substituents are pointing towards the observer and the vertical substituents are away from the observer. Fisher projection formula for tartaric acid is given below.

**Sawhorse projection formula:**

Here the bond between two carbon atoms is drawn diagonally and slightly elongated. The lower left hand carbon is considered lying towards the front and  

the upper right hand carbon towards the back. The Fischer projection inadequately portrays the spatial relationship between ligands attached to adjacent atoms. The sawhorse projection attempts to clarify the relative location of the groups.

**Newman projection formula:**

In this method the molecules are viewed from the front along the carbon- carbon bond axis. The two carbon atom forming the σ bond is represented by two circles. One behind the other so that only the front carbon is seen. The front carbon atom is shown by a point where as the carbon lying further from the eye is represented by the origin of the circle. Therefore, the C-H bonds of the front carbon are depicted from the circle while C-H bonds of the back carbon are drawn from the circumference of the circle with an angle of 1200 to each other.

**11.5. Isomerism in organic compounds:**

The term ‘isomerism’ was given by Berzelius, and its represents of existence




  

of two or more compounds with the same molecular formula but different structure and properties (physical, chemical, or both). Compounds exhibiting this isomerism are called isomers. The difference in properties of two isomers is due to difference in (bond connectivity or spatial arrangement) the arrangement of atoms within their molecules. Isomerism is broadly divided into two types. i. Constitutional isomerism, ii. stereoisomerism.

**ISOMERS** (same molecular formula)

**Constitutional Isomers** (Formerly structural isomers)

(different in bond connectivity)

**Steroisomers** (same in bond connectivity)

**11.5.1 Constitutional isomers (Formerly structural isomers):**

This type of isomers have same molecular formula but differ in their bonding sequence. Structural or constitutional isomerism is further classified into following types.  

**(a) Chain or nuclear or skeletal isomerism:**

These isomers differ in the way in which the carbon atoms are bonded to each other in a carbon chain or in other words isomers have similar molecular formula but differ in the nature of the carbon skeleton (ie. Straight or branched)

**(d) Metamerism: This type of isomerism** is a special kind of structural isomerism arises due to the unequal distribution of carbon atoms on either side of the functional group or different alkyl groups attached to the either side of the same functional group and having same molecular formula. This isomerism is shown by compounds having functional group such as ethers, ketones, esters and secondary amines between two alkyl groups.

**(e) Tautomerism:** It is a special type of functional isomerism in which a single compound exists in two readily inter con- vertible structures that differ markedly in the relative position of atleast one atomic nucleus, generally hydrogen. The two dif- ferent structures are known as tautomers. There are several types of tautomerism and the two important types are dyad and triad systems.

**(i) Dyad system:** In this system hydrogen atom oscillates between two directly linked polyvalent atoms. Eg:

H C N H N C (hydrogencyanide) (hydrogen isocyanide)

In this example hydrogen atom oscillates between carbon & nitrogen atom

**(ii) Triad system:** In this system hydrogen atom oscillates between three polyvalent atoms. It involves 1,3 migration of hydrogen atom from one polyvalent atom to other within the mole- cule. The most important type of triad system is keto–enol tautomerism and the two groups of tautomers are ketoform and enol-form. The polyvalent atoms involved are one oxygen and two carbon atoms. Enolisation is a process in which keto-form is converted to enol form. Both tautomeric forms are not equally stable. The less stable form is known as labile form

**11.5.2 Stereoisomerism:**

**The isomers which have same bond** connectivity but different arrangement of groups or atoms in space are known as stereoisomers. This branch of chemistry dealing with the study of three-dimensional nature (spactial arrangement) of molecules is known as stereo chemistry. The metabolic activities in living organisms, natural synthesis and drug synthesis involve various stereoisomers.

**11.5.3 Geometrical isomerism:**

Geometrical isomers are the stereoisome or atoms around a rigid frame work of double restricted rotation of double bonds, or about sin

In alkenes, the carbon-carbon double bon bond consists of a σ bond and a π bond. The σ hybrid orbitals. The π bond is formed by the s of the π bond lock the molecule in one positio possible. This restriction of rotation about C-C isomerism in alkenes.

**11.5.4 Optical Isomerism**

Compounds having same physical and chemical property but differ only in the rotation of plane of the polarized light are known as optical isomers and the phenomenon is known as optical isomerism.

Some organic compounds such as glucose have the ability to rotate the plane of the plane polarized light and they are said to be optically active compounds and this property of a compound is called optical activity. The optical isomer, which rotates the plane of the plane polarised light to the right or in clockwise direction is said to be dextro rotatary (dexter means right) denoted by the sign (+), whereas the compound which rotates to the left or anticlockwise is said to be leavo rotatary (leavues means left) denoted by sign(-). Dextrorotatory compounds are represented as ‘d’ or by sign (+) and lavorotatory compounds are represented as ‘l’ or by sign (-).

**Enantiomerism and optical activity**

An optically active substance may exist in two or more isomeric forms which have same physical and chemical properties but differ in terms of direction of rotation of plane polarized light, such optical isomers which rotate the plane of polarized light with equal angle but in opposite direction are known as enantiomers and the phenom- enon is known as enantiomerism. Isomers which are non-super imposable mirror images of each other are called enantiomers.

**Conditions for enantiomerism or optical isomerism**

A carbon atom whose tetra valency  

is satisfied by four different substituents (atoms or groups) is called asymmetric carbon or chiral carbon. It is indicated by an asterisk as C\*. A molecule possessing chiral carbon atom and non-super imposable to its own mirror image is said to be a chiral molecule or asymmetric, and the property is called chirality or dissymmetry.

**11.6 Detection of elements in organic compounds**

**Introduction**

The first step in the analysis of an organic compound is the detection of elements present in it. The principal elements are carbon, hydrogen and oxygen In addition to these they may contain nitrogen, sulphur and halogens. Phosphorous. Metals like Li, Mg, Zn are present in certain organometalic compounds.

**Detection of carbon and hydrogen**

If the compound under investigation is or- ganic, there is no need to test for carbon. This test is performed only to establish whether a




  

given compound is organic or not. With the exception of few compounds like CCl4, CS2 all organic compounds also contain hydro- gen. The presence of both these elements is confirmed by the following common test.

**Copper(II)oxide test: The organic** substance is mixed with about three times its weight of dry copper oxide by grinding. The mixture is then placed in a hard glass test tube fitted with a bent delivery tube. The other end of which is dipping into lime water in an another test tube. The mixture is heated strongly and the following reaction take place.

C CO2

CuO H2O +

2H

Thus if carbon is present, it is oxidized to CO2 which turns lime water milky. If hydrogen is also present, it will be oxidized to water which condenses in small droplets on the cooler wall of the test tube and inside the bulb. Water is collected on anhydrous CuSO4 which turns anhydrous CuSO4 blue. This confirms the presence of C and H in the compound.

Detection of nitrogen by lassaigne sodium fusion test: This is a good test for the detection of nitrogen in all classes of nitrogenous compound and it involves the preparation of sodium fusion extract

This method involves the conversion of covalently bonded N, S or halogen present in the organic compounds to corresponding water soluble ions in the form of sodium salts For this purpose a small piece of Na dried by pressing between the folds of a filter paper is taken in a fusion tube and it is gently heated.  

When it melts to a shining globule, put a pinch of the organic compound on it. Heat the tube till reaction ceases and becomes red hot. Plunge it in about 50 mL of distilled water taken in a china dish and break the bottom of the tube by striking against the dish. Boil the contents of the dish for about 10 mts and filter. This filtrate is known as lassaignes extract or sodium fusion extract and it used for detection of nitrogen, sulfur and halogens present in organic compounds.

**ii) Test for Nitrogen:** If nitrogen is present it gets converted to sodium cyanide which reacts with freshly prepared ferrous sulphate and ferric ion followed by conc. HCl and gives a Prussian blue color or green colour or precipitate. It confirms the presence of nitrogen. HCl is added to dissolve the greenish precipitate of ferrous hydroxide produced by the excess of NaOH on FeSO4 which would otherwise mark the Prussian blue precipitate. The following reaction takes part in the formation of Prussian blue.

Na +C + N NaCN

FeSO4 + Fe(OH)2 + Na2SO4

Incase if both N & S are present, a blood red colour is obtained due to the following reactions.




  

Na + C + N + S Heat NaCNS

3NaCNS + FeCl3 Fe(CNS)3 + sodium sulphocyanide

ferric sulphocyanide (Blood red colour)

**iii) Test for sulphur:**

a) To a portion of the lassaigne's extract, add freshly prepared sodium nitro prusside solution. A deep violet or purple colouration is obtained. This test is also used to detect S2- in inorganic salt analysis

Na2S+Na2 \[Fe (CN5) NO\]→Na4 \[Fe (CN5) NOS\]

sodium nitro prusside

b) Acidify another portion of lassaigne's extract with acetic acid and add lead acetate solution. A black precipitate is obtained.

(CH3COO)2Pb +Na2S PbS (black ppt) + 2CH3COONa

c) Oxidation test: The organic substances are fused with a mixture of KNO3 and Na2CO3. The sulphur, if present is oxidized to sulphate.

Na2CO3 + S +3O Na2SO4 + CO2

The fused mass is extracted with water, acidified with HCl and then BaCl2 solution is added to it. A white precipitate indicates the presence of sulphur.

BaCl 2 + Na2SO4 BaSO 4 + 2NaCl

iv) Test for halogens: To another portion of the lassaigne’s filtrate add dil HNO3 warm gently and add AgNO3 solution.  

a) Appearance of curdy white precipitate soluble in ammonia solution indicates the presence of chlorine.

b) Appearance of pale yellow precipitate sparingly soluble in ammonia solution indicates the presence of bromine.

c) Appearance of a yellow precipitate insoluble in ammonia solution indicates the presence of iodine.

Nax + AgNO3 AgX + NaNO3

If N or S is present in the compound along with the halogen, we might obtain NaCN and Na2S in the solution, which interfere with the detection of the halogen in the AgNO3 test Therefore we boil the lassaignes extract with HNO3 which decomposes NaCN and Na2S as

NaCN + HNO3 NaNO3 + HCN

Na2S + 2HNO3 2NaNO3 + H2S

NaCN + AgNO3 AgCN + NaNO3

**V) Test for phosphorous:** A solid compound is strongly heated with a mixture of Na2CO3 & KNO3. phosphorous present in the compound is oxidized to sodium phosphate. The residue is extracted with water and boiled with Conc. HNO3. A solution of ammonium molybdate is added to the above solution. A canary yellow coloration or precipitate shows the presence of phosphorous.




  

**11.7 Estimation of elements**

After detecting the various elements present in a given organic compound by qualitative analysis it is necessary to determine their composition by weight. The estimation of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur halogens are discussed here. No dependable method is however available for determination oxygen and hence its amount is always determined by difference.

**Estimation of carbon and hydrogen:** Both carbon and hydrogen are estimated by the same method. A known weight of the organic substance is burnt in excess of ox- ygen and the carbon and hydrogen present in it are oxidized to carbon dioxide and wa- ter, respectively.

Cx Hy + O2 (in excess)

xCO 2 + H2O y 2

The weight of carbon dioxide and water thus formed are determined and the amount of carbon and hydrogen in the organic substance is calculated.

The apparatus employed for the purpose consists of three units (i) oxygen

Fig 11.2 Estimatio  

supply (2) combustion tube (3) absorption apparatus. (see Fig. 11.2)

**(1) Oxygen supply:** To remove the moisture from oxygen it is allowed to bubble through sulphuric acid and then passed through a U-tube containing sodalime to remove CO2. The oxygen gas free from moisture and carbondioxide enters the combustion tube.

**(2) Combustion tube:** A hard glass tube open at both ends is used for the combustion of the organic substance. It contains (i) an oxidized copper gauze to prevent the backward diffusion of the products of combustion (ii) a porcelain boat containing a known weight of the organic substance (iii) coarse copper oxide on either side and (iv) an oxidized copper gauze placed towards the end of the combustion tube. The combustion tube is heated by a gas burner.

**(3) Absorption Apparatus: The** combustion products containing moisture and carbon-dioxide are then passed through the absorption apparatus which consists of (1) a weighed U-tube

n of Carbon and Hydrogen




  

packed with pumice soaked in Conc. H2SO4to absorb water (ii) a set of bulbs containing a strong solution of KOH to absorb CO2and finally (iii) a guard tube filled with anhydrous CaCl2 to prevent the entry of moisture from atmosphere.

**Procedure: The combustion tube is heated** strongly to dry its content. It is then cooled slightly and connected to the absorption apparatus. The other end of the combustion tube is open for a while and the boat containing weighed organic substance is introduced. The tube is again heated strongly till the substance in the boat is burnt away. This takes about 2 hours. Finally, a strong current of oxygen is passed through the combustion tube to sweap away any traces of carbon dioxide or moisture which may be left in it. The U-tube and the potash bulbs are then detached and the increase in weight of each of them is determined.

**Calculation:**

Weight of the organic substance taken = w g

Increase in weight of H2O = x g

Increase in weight of CO2 = y g

18 g of H2O contains 2g of hydrogen

∴ _x_ g of H2O contains ( 2 18

_x_)g of hydrogen

Percentage of hydrogen=( 2 18

× _x_ w

×100)%

44g of CO2 contains 12g of carbon

∴ _y_ g of CO2 contains (12 44

_y_) g of carbon

Percentage of Carbon=(12 44

× _y_ w

×100)%  

**Note:**

1\. If the organic substance under investigation also contain N, it will produce oxides of nitrogen on combustion. A spiral of copper is introduced at the combustion tube, to reduce the oxides of nitrogen to nitrogen which escapes unabsorbed.

2\. If the compound contains halogen as well, a spiral of silver is also introduced in the combustion tube. It converts halogen into silver halide.

3\. In case if the substance also contains sulphur, the copper oxide in the combustion tube is replaced by lead chromate. The SO2 formed during combustion is thus converted to lead sulphate and prevented from passing into the absorption unit.

**Worked out example: 1**

0.26g of an organic compound gave 0.039 g of water and 0.245 g of carbon dioxide on combustion. Calculate the percentage of C & H

The resulting solution is treated with excess of BaCl2 solution H2SO4 present in the solution in quantitatively converted into BaSO4, from the mass of BaSO4, the mass of sulphur and hence the percentage of sulphur in the compound can be calculated.

**Procedure:**

A known mass of the organic compound is taken in clean carius tube and  

added a few mL of fuming HNO3. The tube is the sealed. It is then placed in an iron tube and heated for about 5 hours. The tube is allowed to cool to room temperature and a small hole is made to allow gases produced inside to escape. The carius tube is broken and the content collected in a beaker. Excess of BaCl2 is added to the beaker contains H2SO4 acid as a result of the reaction is converted to BaSO4. The precipitate of BaSO4 is filtered, washed, dried and weighed. From the mass of BaSO4, percentage of S is found.

Mass of the organic compound = w g

Mass of the BaSO4 formed = _x_ g

**Estimation of nitrogen: There are two** methods for the estimation of nitrogen in an organic compound. They are 1. Dumas method 2. Kjeldahls method

**1\. Dumas method:**

This method is based upon the fact that nitrogenous compound when heated with cupric oxide in an atmosphere of CO2 yields free nitrogen. Thus

CX HY NZ + (2X + Y/2) CuO x CO2 + Y/2 H2O + Z/2 N2 + (2X + Y/2) Cu

Traces of oxide of nitrogen, which may be formed in some cases, are reduced to elemental nitrogen by passing over heated copper spiral.  

The apparatus used in Dumas method consists of CO2 generator, combustion tube, Schiffs nitrometer. (See Fig. 11.4)

**CO2 generator:**

CO2 needed in this process is prepared by heating magnetite or sodium bicarbonate contained in a hard glass tube or by the action of dil. HCl on marble in a kipps apparatus. The gas is passed through the combustion tube after being dried by bubbling through Conc. H2SO4.

**Combustion Tube: The combustion tube is** heated in a furnace is charged with a) A roll of oxidized copper gauze to prevent the back diffusion of the products of combustion and to heat the organic substance mixed with CuO by radiation b) a weighed amount of the organic substance mixed with excess of CuO, C) a layer of course CuO packed in about 2/3 of the entire length of the tube and kept in position by loose asbestos plug on either side; this oxidizes the organic vapors passing through it, and d) a reduced copper spiral which reduces any oxides of nitrogen formed during combustion to nitrogen.

**Schiff ’s nitro meter: The nitrogen gas** obtained by the decomposition of the substance in the combustion tube is mixed with considerable excess of CO2 It is estimated by passing nitrometer when CO2 is absorbed by KOH and the nitrogen gets collected in the upper part of graduated tube.

**Procedure:** To start with the tap of nitro meter is left open. CO2 is passed through the combustion tube to expel the air in it. When the gas bubbles rising through, the




  

potash solution fails to reach the top of it and is completely absorbed it shows that only CO2 is coming and that all air has been expelled from the combustion tube. The nitrometer is then filled with KOH solution by lowering the reservoir and the tap is closed. The combustion tube is now heated in the furnace and the temperature rises gradually. The nitrogen set free form the compound collects in the nitro meter. When the combustion is complete a strong current of CO2 is sent through, the apparatus in order to sweep the last trace of nitrogen from it. The volume of the gas gets collected is noted after adjusting the reservoir so that the solution in it and the graduated tube is the same. The atmospheric pressure and the temperature are also recorded.

Dumas method is a high precision method and is generally preferred over Kjeldahl's method.

**Kjeldahls method:**

This method is carried much more easily than the Dumas method. It is used largely in the analysis of foods and fertilizers. Kjeldahls method is based on the fact that when an organic compound containing nitrogen is heated with Conc. H2SO4, the nitrogen in it is quantitatively converted to ammonium sulphate. The resultant liquid is then treated with excess of alkali and then liberated ammonia gas absorbed in excess of standard acid. The amount of ammonia (and hence nitrogen) is determined by finding the amount of acid neutralized by back titration with same standard alkali.

Fig 11.3 Kjeld  

**Procedure:**

A weighed quantity of the substance (0.3 to 0.5 g) is placed in a special long – necked Kjeldahl flask made of pyrex glass. About 25 mL of Conc. H2SO4 together with a little K2SO4 and CuSO4 (catalyst) are added to it the flask is loosely stoppered by a glass bulb and heated gently in an inclined position. The heating is continued till the brown color of the liquid first produced, disappears leaving the contents clear as before. At this point all the nitrogen in the substance is converted to (NH4)2SO4. The Kjeldahl flask is then cooled and its contents are diluted with distilled water and then carefully transferred into a 1 lit round bottom flask. An excess NaOH solution is poured down the side of the flask and it is fitted with a Kjeldahl trap and a water condenser. The lower end of the

condenser dips in a measured volume of

excess the N 20

H2SO4 solution. The liquid in

the round bottom flask is then heated and the liberated ammonia is distilled into sulphuric acid. The Kjeldahl trap serves to retain any alkali splashed up on vigorous boiling. (See Fig. 11.3)

ahls method




  

When no more ammonia passes over (test the distillate with red litmus) the receiver is removed. The excess of acid is then determined by titration with alkali, using phenolphthalein as the indicator.

**Calculation:**

Weight of the substance = Wg.

Volume of H2SO4 required for the complete neutralisation of evolved NH3 = V mL.

**11.8 Purification of organic compounds**

**Need for purification:**

In order to study the structure, physical properties, chemical properties and biological properties of organic compounds they must be in the pure state. There are several methods by which organic compounds can be purified. The methods employed for purification depend upon the nature of impurity and the nature of organic compound. The most widely used technique for the separation and purification of organic compounds are: (a) Crystallisation, (b) Sublimation (c) Distillation (d) Fractional distillation (e) Steam distillation (f) Azeotropic distillation (g) Differential extraction and (h) Chromatography.

Liquids are purified by

Solids are purified by Sublimation Crystallisation

Fractional Crystallisation distillation

**11.8.1 Sublimation:**

Few substances like benzoic acid, naphthalene and camphor when heated pass directly from solid to vapor without melting (ie liquid). On cooling the vapours will give back solids. Such phenomenon is called sublimation. It is a useful technique to separate volatile and non-volatile solid. It has limited application because only a few substance will sublime.  

Substances to be purified is taken in a beaker. It is covered with a watch glass. The beaker is heated for a while and the resulting vapours condense on the bottom of the watch glass. Then the watch glass is removed and the crystals are collected. This method is applicable for organic substance which has high vapour pressure at temperature below their melting point. Substances like naphthalene, benzoic acid can be sublimed quickly. Substance which has very small vapour pressure will decompose upon heating are purified by sublimation under reduced pressure. This apparatus consists of large heating and large cooling surface with small distance in between because the amount of the substance in the vapour phase is much too small in case of a substance with low vapour pressure.

**11.8.2 Crystallization:**

It is the most widely used method for the purification of solid organic compound. This process is carried out in by the follow- ing step

**(i) Selection of solvent:** Most of the organic substances being covalent do not dissolve in polar solvents like water, hence selection of solvent (suitable) becomes necessary. Hence the powdered organic substance is taken in a test tube and the solvent is added little by little with constant stirring and heating, till the amount added is just sufficient to dissolve the solute(ie) organic compound. If the solid dissolves upon heating and throws out maximum crystals on cooling, then the solvent is suitable. This process is repeated with other solvents like benzene, ether, acetone and alcohol till the most suitably one is sorted out.







|------|




|------|





  

**(ii) Preparation of solution: The** organic substance is dissolved in a minimum quantity of suitable solvent. Small amount of animal charcoal can be added to decolorize any colored substance. The heating may be done over a wire gauze or water bath depending upon the nature of liquid (ie) whether the solvent is low boiling or high boiling.

**(iii) Filtration of hot solution: The hot** solution so obtained is filtered through a fluted filter paper placed in a funnel.

**(iv) Crystallization: The hot filtrate is** then allowed to cool. Most of the impurities are removed on the filter paper, the pure solid substance separate as crystal. When copious amount of crystal has been obtained, then the crystallization is complete. If the rate of crystallization is slow, it is induced either by scratching the walls of the beaker with a glass rod or by adding a few crystals of the pure compounds to the solution.

**(v) Isolation and drying of crystals:** The crystals are separated from the mother liquor by filtration. Filtration is done under reduced pressure using a Bucher funnel. When the whole of the mother liquor has been drained into the filtration flask, the crystals are washed with small quantities of the pure cold solvent and then dried.

**11.8.3 Distillation:**

**This method is to purify liquids** from non-volatile impurities, and used for separating the constituents of a liquid mixture which differ in their boiling points. There are various methods of distillation depending upon the difference in the boiling points of the constituents. The methods  

are (i) simple distillation (ii) fractional distillation and (iii) steam distillation. The process of distillation involves the impure liquid when boiled gives out vapour and the vapour so formed is collected and condensed to give back the pure liquid in the receiver. This method is called simple distillation. Liquids with large difference in boiling point (about 40k) and do not decompose under ordinary pressure can be purified by simply distillation eg. The mixture of C6H5NO2 (b.p 484k) & C6H6(354k) and mixture of diethyl ether (b.p 308k) and ethyl alcohol (b.p 351k)

**Fractional distillation: This is one** method to purify and separate liquids present in the mixture having their boiling point close to each other. In the fractional distillation, a fractionating column is fitted with distillation flask and a condenser. A thermometer is fitted in the fractionating column near the mouth of the condenser. This will enable to record the temperature of vapour passing over the condenser. The process of separation of the components in a liquid mixture at their respective boiling points in the form of vapours and the subsequent condensation of those vapours is called fractional distillation. The process of fractional distillation is repeated, if necessary. This method finds a remarkable application in distillation of petroleum, coal-tar and crude oil.

**11.8.4 Steam distillation:**

**This method is applicable for solids** and liquids. If the compound to be steam distilled the it should not decompose at the steam temperature, should have a fairly high vapour pressure at 373k, it should be insoluble in water and the impurities present should be non-volatile.




  

Fig 11.4 Steam distillation

The impure liquid along with little water is taken in a round-bottom flask which is connected to a boiler on one side and water condenser on the other side, the flask is kept in a slanting position so that no droplets of the mixture will enter into the condenser on the brisk boiling and bubbling of steam. The mixture in the flask is heated and then a current of steam passed in to it. The vapours of the compound mix up with steam and escape into the condenser. The condensate obtained is a mixture of water and organic compound which can be separated. This method is used to recover essential oils from plants and flowers, also in the manufacture of aniline and turpentine oil. (see Fig. 11.4)

**11.8.5 Azeotropic Distillation**

These are the mixture of liquids that cannot be separated by fractional distillation. The mixtures that can be purified only by azeotropic distillation are called as azeotropes. These azeotropes are constant boiling mixtures, which distil as a single component at a fixed temperature. For example ethanol and water in the ratio of 95.87:4.13.

In this method the presence of a third component like C6H6, CCl4, ether, glycerol, glycol which act as a dehydrating agent depress the partial pressure of one component of azeotropic mixture and raises  

the boiling point of that component and thus other component will distil over.

Subtances like C6H6, CCl4 have low boiling points and reduce the partial vapour pressure of alcohol more than that of water while subtances like glycerol & glycol etc. have high boiling point and reduce the partial vapour pressure of water more than that of alcohol.

**11.8.6 Differential extraction:**

**The process of removing a substance** from its aqueous solution by shaking with a suitable organic solvent is termed extraction. When an organic substance present as solution in water can be recovered from the solution by means of a separating funnel. The aqueous solution is taken in a separating funnel with little quantity of ether or chloroform (CHCl3). The organic solvent immiscible with water will form a separate layer and the contents are shaken gently. The solute being more soluble in the organic solvent is transfered to it. The solvent layer is then separated by opening the tap of the separating funnel, and the substance is recovered.

**11.8.7 Chromatography:**

**The most valuable method for the** separation and purification of small quantity of mixtures. As name implies chroma-colour and graphed writing it was first applied to separation of different colored constituents of chlorophyll in 1906 by M.S Tswett, a Russian botanist. He achieved it by passing a petroleum ether solution of chlorophyll present in leaves through a column of CaCO3 firmly packed into a narrow glass tube. Different components of the pigments got separated into land or zones of different




  

colors and now this technique is equally well applied to separation of colorless substances.

The principle behind chromatography is selective distribution of the mixture of organic substances between two phases – a stationary phase and a moving phase. The stationary phase can be a solid or liquid, while the moving phase is a liquid or a gas. When the stationary phase is a solid, the moving phase is a liquid or a gas. If the stationary phase is solid, the basis is adsorption, and when it is a liquid, the basis is partition. So the Chromatography is defined as a technique for the separation of a mixture brought about by differential movement of the individual compound through porous medium under the influence of moving solvent. The various methods of chromatography are

1\. Column chromatography (CC)

2\. Thin layer chromatography (TLC)

3\. Paper chromatography (PC)

4\. Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)

5\. Ion–exchange chromatography

**Adsorption chromatography: The** principle involved is different compounds are adsorbed on an adsorbent to different degree. Silica gel and alumina are the commonly used adsorbent. The components of the mixture move by varying distances over the stationary phase. Column chromatography and thin layer chromatography are the techniques based on the principle of differential adsorption.

**Column chromatography: This is the** simplest chromatographic method carried out in long glass column having a stop cock  

near the lower end. This method involves separation of a mixture over a column of adsorbent (Stationery phase) packed in a column. In the column a plug of cotton or glass wool is placed at the lower end of the column to support the adsorbent powder. The tube is uniformLy packed with suitable absorbent constitute the stationary phase. (Activated aluminum oxides (alumina), Magnesium oxide, starch are also used as absorbents).

Fig 11.5 Column Chromatography

The mixture to be separated is placed on the top of the adsorbent column. Eluent which is a liquid or a mixture of liquids is allowed to flow down the column slowly. Different components are eluted depending upon the degree to which the components are adsorbed and complete separation takes place. The most readily adsorbed substances




  

are retained near the top and others come down to various distances in the column.

**Thin layer chromatography: This** method is an another type of adsorption chromatography with this method it is possible to separate even minute quantities of mixtures. A sheet of a glass is coated with a thin layer of adsorbent (cellulose, silica gel or alumina). This sheet of glass is called chromoplate or thin layer chromatography plate. After drying the plate, a drop of the mixture is placed just above one edge and the plate is then placed in a closed jar containing eluent (solvent). The eluent is drawn up the adsorbent layer by capillary action. The components of the mixture move up along with the eluent to different distances depending upon their degree of adsorption of each component of the mixture. It is expressed in terms of its retention factor (ie) Rf value

Rf =

Distance moved by the substance from base line (x)

Distance moved by the solvent from base line (y)

The spots of colored compounds are visible on TLC plate due to their original color. The colorless compounds are viewed under uv light or in another method using iodine crystals or by using appropriate reagent.

**Partition chromatography:** Paper chro- matography (PC) is an example of parti- tion chromatography. The same procedure is followed as in thin layer chromatog- raphy except that a strip of paper acts as an adsorbent. This method involves con- tinues differential portioning of compo- nents of a mixture between stationary and  

mobile phase. In paper chromatography, a special quality paper known as chroma- tography paper is used. This paper act as a stationary phase. A strip of chromatographic paper spotted at the base with the solution of the mixture is suspended in a suitable solvent which act as the mobile phase. The solvent rises up and flows over the spot. The paper selectively retains different components according to their different partition in the two phases where a chromatogram is developed. The spots of the separated colored compounds are visible at different heights from the position of initial spots on the chromatogram. The spots of the separated colorless compounds may be observed either under ultraviolent light or by the use of an appropriate spray reagent.
