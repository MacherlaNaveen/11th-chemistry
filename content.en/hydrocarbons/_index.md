**13.2.1 Preparation of alkanes:**

Alkanes are not laboratory curiosities but they are extremely important naturally occurring compounds. Natural gas and petroleum (crude oil) are the most important natural sources. However, it can be prepared by the following methods.

**1\. Preparation of alkanes from cata- lytic reduction of unsaturated hydro- carbons.**

When a mixture hydrogen gas with alkene or alkyne gas is passed over a catalysts such as platinum or palladium at room temperature, an alkane is produced. This process of addition of H2 to unsaturated compounds is known as hydrogenationThe above process can be catalysed by nickel at 298K. This reaction is known as Sabatier- Sendersens reaction

for example:

CH CH2 H 2 CH3 CH2 propene propane

CH3 CH3Pt

CH2 CH2 H2 CH3 CH3

ethene ethane298K Ni

C C H 2H2 prop-1-yne

CH3 CH3 CH2 propane

CH3 Pt

**2\. Preparation of alkanes from carboxylic acids:**

**i) Decarboxylation of sodium salt of carboxylic acid**

When a mixture of sodium salt of carboxylic acid and soda lime (sodium hydroxide + calcium oxide) is heated, alkane is formed. The alkane formed has one carbon atom less than carboxylic acid. This process of eliminating carboxylic group is known as decarboxylation.  

for example:

CH3COONa + NaOH Sodium acetate

CH4+ Na2CO3

Methane

CaO

**ii) Kolbe’s Electrolytic method**

When sodium or potassium salt of carboxylic acid is electrolyzed, a higher alkane is formed. The decarboxylative dimerization of two carboxylic acid occurs. This method is suitable for preparing symmetrical alkanes(R-R).

**3.Preparation of alkanes using alkyl halides (or) halo alkanes**

**i) By reduction with nascent hydrogen**

Except alkyl fluorides, other alkyl halides can be converted to alkanes by reduction with nascent hydrogen. The hydrogen for reduction may be obtained by using any of the following reducing agents: Zn+HCl, Zn+CH3COOH, Zn-Cu couple in ethanol, LiAlH4 etc.,

for example:

CH2 Cl chloro propane

Zn/HCl

CH2CH3

HClCH3 CH2 CH3 propane

\[H\]

**ii) Wurtz reaction**

When a solution of halo alkanes in dry ether is treated with sodium metal,




  

higher alkanes are produced. This reaction is used to prepare higher alkanes with even number of carbon atoms.

for example:

CH3 CH3 2NaBr ethane

CH3 Br methyl bromide

Br CH3 dry ether

2Na

**iii) Corey- House Mechanism**

An alkyl halide and lithium di alkyl copper are reacted to give higher alkane.

for example:

CH3 CH2 Br ethyl bromide

+(CH 3)2CuLi

propane CH 3CH 2CH 3 +CH 3Cu LiBr+

**4) Preparation of Alkanes from Gri- gnard reagents**

Halo alkanes reacts with magnesium in the presence of dry ethers to give alkyl magnesium halide which is known as Grignard reagents. Here the alkyl group is directly attached to the magnesium metal make it to behave as carbanion. So, any compound with easily replaceable hydrogen reacts with Grignard reagent to give corresponding alkanes.

for example:

CH3 Cl Mg chloromethane

Dry ether CH3MgCl

methyl magnesium chloride

CH3MgCl H2O CH methane

4 + Mg(OH)Cl

**1) Boiling Point and Physical state**

The boiling point of continuous chain alkanes increases with increases in length of carbon chain roughly about 30°C for every added carbon atom to the chain. Being non polar, alkanes have weak Vanderwal’s force which depends upon molecular surface area and hence increases with increase molecular size. We observe that with same number of carbon atoms, straight chain isomers have

higher boiling point compared to branch chain isomers. The boiling point decreases with increase in branching as the molecule becomes compact and the area of the contact decreases.

**2) Solubility and density**

Water molecules are polar and alkanes are non-polar. The insolubility of alkanes in water makes them good water repellent for metals which protects the metal surface from corrosion. Because of their lower density than water, they form two layers and occupy top layer. The density difference between alkanes and water explains why oil spills in aqueous environment spread so quickly.

Apples produce its own wax which contains long unbranched alkanes (C27H56 and C29H60).

This natural wax helps the apple to resist moisture lost, enhances the fruit firmness and slowdowns its natural degradation. The consumption of apple with artificial wax coating is harmful to the digestive system

**13.2.3 Conformations of alkane:**

Each carbon in alkanes is sp3 hybridized and the four groups or atoms around the carbon are tetrahedrally bonded. In alkanes having two or more carbons, there exists free rotation about C-C single bond. Such rotation leaves all the groups or atoms bonded to each carbon into an  

infinite number of readily interconvertible three dimensional arrangements. Such readily interconvertible three dimensional arrangement of a molecule is called conformations.

**(i) Conformations of ethane:**

The two tetrahedral methyl groups can rotate about the carbon – carbon bond axis yielding several arrangements called conformers. The extreme conformations are staggered and eclipsed conformation. There can be number of other arrangements between staggered and eclipsed forms and their arrangements are known as skew forms.

**Eclipsed conformation:**

In this conformation, the hydrogen’s of one carbon are directly behind those of the other. The repulsion between the atoms is maximum and it is the least stable conformer.




  

**Staggered conformation:**

In this conformation, the hydrogens of both the carbon atoms are far apart from each other. The repulsion between the atoms is minimum and it is the most stable conformer.

**Skew Conformation :**

The infinite numbers of possible intermediate conformations between the two extreme conformations are referred as skew conformations.

The stabilities of various conformations of ethane are

Staggered > Skew > Eclipsed

The potential energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed conformation of ethane is around 12.5 KJmol-1. The various conformations can be represented by new man projection formula.

**Eclipsed conformation:**

In this conformation, the distance between the two methyl group is minimum. So there is maximum repulsion between them and it is the least stable conformer.

**Anti or staggered form**

In this conformation, the distance between the two methyl groups is maximum and so there is minimum repulsion between them. And it is the most stable conformer.

**13.2.4 Chemical properties:**

Alkanes are quite unreactive towards most reagents. However under favorable conditions, alkanes undergo the following type of reaction.

Paraffin is the older name for the alkane group family of compounds. This name comes from the Latin which means ‘little activity’

**1) Combustion:**

A combustion reaction is a chemical reaction between a substances and oxygen with evolution of heat and light (usually as a flame). In the presence of sufficient oxygen, alkanes undergoes combustion when ignited and produces carbondioxide and water.

for example:

CH4 CO22O2 2H2O ∆H°=-890.4kJ

When alkanes burn in insufficient supply of oxygen, they form carbonmonoxide and carbon black.

**2) Halogenation:**

Halogenation reaction is the chemical reaction between an alkane and halogen  

in which one or more hydrogen atoms are substituted by the halogens.

Chlorination and Bromination are two widely used halogenation reactions. Fluorination is too quick and iodination is too slow. Methane reacts with chlorine in the presence of light or when heated as follows.

CH4 + Cl2 CH methyl chloride

**Mechanism:**

The reaction proceeds through the free radical chain mechanism. This mechanism is characterized by three steps initiation, propagation and termination.

i) CHAIN INITITATION: The chain is initiated by UV light leading to homolytic fission of chlorine molecules into free radicals (chlorine atoms).

2Cl.Cl Cl

Here we choose Cl-Cl bond for fission because C-C & C-H bonds are stronger than Cl-Cl.

ii) **PROPAGATION:** It proceeds as follows,

(a) Chlorine free radial attacks the methane molecule and breaks the C-H bond resulting in the generation of methyl free radical




  

\+ . .Cl CH3 +HClhCH3 H υ

(b) The methyl free radical thus obtained attacks the second molecule of chlorine to give chloromethane (CH3Cl) and a chlorine free radical as follows.

\+ CH3ClCH3 Cl-Cl Cl+

(c) This chlorine free radical then cycles back to step (a) and both step (a) and (b) are repeated many times and thus chain of reaction is set up.

**iii) Chain termination:**

After sometimes, the reactions stops due to consumption of reactant and the chain is terminated by the combination of free radicals.

**3) Aromatisation**

Alkanes with six to ten carbon atoms are converted into homologous of benzene at high temperature and in the presence of catalyst. This process is known as aromatization. It occurs by simultaneous  

cyclisation followed by dehydrogenation of alkanes.

Methane reacts with steam at 1273K in the presence of Nickel and decomposes to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas.

CH (g) (g) (g)(g)+H2 2O CO + H3 Ni

1273K

Production of H2 gas from methane is known as steam reforming process and it is a well-established industrial process for the production of H2 gas from hydrocarbons.

**5) Pyrolysis**

Pyrolysis is defined as the thermal decomposition of organic compound into smaller fragments in the absence of air through the application of heat. ‘Pyro’ means ‘fire’ and ‘lysis’ means ‘separating’. Pyrolysis of alkanes also named as cracking.

In the absence of air, when alkane vapours are passed through red-hot metal it breaks down into simpler hydrocarbons.

The products depends upon the nature of alkane, temperature, pressure and presence or absence of catalyst. The ease of cracking in alkanes increases with increase in molecular weight and branching in alkanes. Cracking plays an important role in petroleum industry.

**6) Isomerisation:**

Isomerisation is a chemical process by which a compound is transformed into any of its isomeric forms. Normal alkanes can be converted into branched alkanes in the presence of AlCl3 and HCl at 298 k.

CH2 CH3CH2CH3 AlCl3/HCl CH CH3CH3

CH3298 K

This process is of great industrial importance. The quality of gasoline is improved by isomerising its components.

**Uses**

The exothermic nature of alkane combustion reaction explains the extensive use of alkanes as fuels. Methane present in natural gas is used in home heating. Mixture of propane and butane are known as LPG gas which is used for domestic cooking purpose. GASOLINE is a complex mixture of many hydrocarbons used as a fuel for internal- combustion engines.  

Carbon black is used in the manufacture of ink, printer ink and black pigments. It is also used as fillers.

**13.3.Alkenes:**

Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain carbon-carbon double bond. They are represented by the general formulae CnH2n where ‘n’ stands for number of carbon atoms in the molecule. Alkenes are also known as olefins (in Latin - oil maker) because the first member ethene combines with chlorine gas to form an oily liquid as a product.

**13.3.1: General methods of prepara- tion of alkenes:**

**(1) Preparation of alkene by dehydra- tion of alcohol:**

When an alcohol is heated at 430- 440 K with excess of concentrated sulphuric acid, a molecule of water from alcohol is removed and an alkene is formed. This reaction is called elimination reaction.

**(2)Preparation of alkenes from alkynes:**

Alkynes can be reduced to cis- alkenes using Lindlar’s catalyst (CaCO3 sup- ported in palladuium partially deactivated with sulphur (or) gasoline). This reaction is stero specific giving only the cis- alkene.

**13.3.2. Physical properities of alkenes:**

The first three members (Ethene, Propene and Butene) are gases, next fourteen members are liquids and the higher alkenes are waxy solids. They are all colourless and odourless except ethene which has a sweet smell.

1\. The melting and boiling point of alkenes increases along the homologous series. Like alkanes, straight chain alkenes have high boiling point compared to its isomeric branched alkenes.

2\. Alkenes are slightly soluble in water but readily in organic solvents.

13.3.3. Chemical properties of alkenes:

Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the presence of a double bond. The σ- bond is strong but the π- bond is weak. The typical reactions of alkenes involve addition of an electrophile across the double bonds proceeding through ionic mechanism. However addition reactions proceed through free-radical mechanism also. Ozonolysis and polymerization are some of the characteristic reactions of alkenes.

**(i) Addition Reactions**

**(ii) Addition of hydrogen: (Hydroge- nation of alkenes)**

hydrogen adds on to alkenes in the presence of a metal catalyst (Ni, Pd (or) Pt) to yield corresponding alkanes. This is known




  

as catalytic hydrogenation. This process is of great importance in the manufacture of vanaspathi from vegetable oil. This helps to prevent rancidity of vegetable oils.

**(ii) Addition of halogens: (Halogenation of alkenes)**

When alkene is treated with halogens like chlorine or bromine, addition takes place rapidly and forms 1, 2- dihalo alkane (or) vicinal dihalide.

TEST FOR ALKENE:

Bromine in water is reddish brown colour. When small amount of bromine water is added to an alkene, the solution is decolourised as it forms dibromo compound. So, this is the characteristic test for unsaturated compounds.  

**Markovnikoff ’s rule:**

“When an unsymmetrical alkene reacts with hydrogen halide, the hydrogen adds to the carbon that has more number of hydrogen and halogen add to the car- bon having fewer hydrogen”. This rule can also be stated as in the addition reaction of alkene / alkyne, the most electro negative part of the reagent adds on to the least hy- drogen attached doubly bonded carbon.

**(iii) Addition of water:- (Hydration of alkenes)**

Normally, water does not react with alkenes. In the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid, alkenes react with water to form alcohols. This reaction follows carbo- cation mechanism and Markovnikoff ’s rule.

**(iv) Addition of hydrohalides: (Hydrohalogenation of Alkenes)**

Hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr and HI) add to alkene to yield alkyl halides. The order of reactivity of different hydrogen ha- lides is HI>HBr>HCl. It is an example for electrophilic addition.

**(a) Addition of HBr to symmetrical alkene:**

Addition of HBr to symmetrical alkene (similar groups are attached to dou- ble bond) yields alkyl halides (haloalkanes)

**Mechanism:**

Consider addition of HBr to propene

**Step: 1** Formation of electrophile:

In H-Br, Br is more electronegative than H. When bonded electron moves toward Br, polarity is developed and creates an electrophile H+ which attacks the double bond to form carbocation, as shown below.

**Step:2** Secondary carbocation is more stable than primary carbocation and it predominates over a the primary carbocation.

**Step:3 The Br ion attacks the 2°** carbocation to form 2-Bromo propane, as the major product.

Consider addition of HBr to 3-methyl-1-butene. Here the expected product according to markovnikoff ’s rule is 2-bromo-3-methyl butane but the actual major product is 2-Bromo-2-methyl butane. This is because, the secondary carbocation formed during the reaction rearranged to more stable tertiary carbocation. Attack of Br– on this tertiary carbocation gives the major product 2-bromo-2-methyl butane.

The H-Cl bond is stronger (430.5  

kJmol-1) than H-Br bond (363.7 kJmol-1), thus H-Cl is not cleaved by the free radical. The H-I bond is weaker (296.8 kJ mol-1), than H-Cl bond. Thus H-I bond breaks easily but iodine free radicals combine to form iodine molecules instead of adding to the double bond and hence peroxide effect is not observed in HCl& HI.

**Kharasch Addition**

Metal catalysed free radical addition of CXCl3 Compounds to alkene is called Kharash addition reaction

**(v) Addition of sulphuric acid to alkenes**

**13.5.3. Structure of benzene:**

**1\. Molecular formula**

Elemental Analysis and molecular weight determination have proved that the molecular formula of benzene is C6H6. This indicates that benzene is a highly unsaturated compound.

**2\. Straight chain structure not possible:**

Benzene could be constructed as a straight chain or ring compound but it not feasible since it does not show the properties of alkenes or alkynes.for example, it did not decolourise bromine in carbon tetrachloride or acidified KMnO4. It did not react with water in the presence of acid.

**3\. Evidence of cyclic structure:**

**I) substitution of benzene:**

Benzene reacts with bromine in the presence of AlCl3 to form mono bromo benzene.

C6H6 + AlCl

C6 5H + HBrBr bromobenzene

3Br 3

2

Formation of only one monobromo compound indicates that all the six hydrogen atoms in benzene were identical. This is possible only if it has a cyclic structure of six carbons each containing one hydrogen.

**II) addition of hydrogen:**

Benzene can add on to three moles of hydrogen in the presence of nickel catalyst to give cyclohexane.

C6H6 + Raney Ni

C6 12H cyclohexane

3H2  

This confirms cyclic structure of ben- zene and the presence of three carbon-car- bon double bond.

**4\. Kekule’s structure of benzene:**

In 1865, August Kekule suggested that benzene consists of a cyclic planar structure of six carbon with alternate single and double bonds.

There were two objections:

(i) Benzene forms only one ortho disubstituted products whereas the Kekule’s structure predicts two o-di substituted products as shown below.

**A**

**A**

**A**

**A**

Presence of double bond between the substituents

Presence of single bond between the substituents

(ii) Kekule’s structure failed to explain why benzene with three double bonds did not give addition reactions like other alkenes. To overcome this objection, Kekule suggested that benzene was mixture of two forms (1 and 2)which are in rapid equilibri- um.

**5\. Resonance description of benzene:**

The phenomenon in which two or more structures can be written for a substance which has identical position




  

of atoms is called resonance. The actual structure of the molecule is said to be resonance hybrid of various possible alternative structures. In benzene, Kekule’s structures I & II represented the resonance structure, and structure III is the resonance hybrid of structure I &II

**\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]**

The structures 1 and 2 exist only in theory. The actual structure of benzene is the hybrid of two hypothetical resonance structures.

**6\. Spectrosscopic measurments:**

Spectroscopic measurements show that benzene is planar and all of its carbon- carbon bonds are of equal length 1.40A°. This value lies between carbon-carbon single bond length 1.54A° and carbon- carbon double bond length 1.34A°.

**7\. Molecular orbital structre:**

The structure of benzene is best described in terms of the molecular orbital theory. All the six carbon atoms of benzene are sp2 hybridized. Six sp2 hybrid orbitals of carbon linearly overlap with six 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form six C - H sigma bonds. Overlap between the remaining sp2

hybrid orbitals of carbon forms six C-C sigma bonds.

Figure13.6. Formation of Sigma bond in benzene

All the σ bonds in benzene lie in one plane with bond angle 120°. Each carbon atom in benzene possess an un hybridized p-orbital containing one electron. The lateral overlap of their p-orbital produces 3 π- bond The six electrons of the p-orbitals cover all the six carbon atoms and are said to be delocalised. Due to delocalization, strong π-bond is formed which makes the molecule stable. Hence unlike alkenes and alkynes benzene undergoes substitution reactions rather addition reactions under normal conditions.

**13.5.7 directive influence of a functional group in monosubtituted benzene:**

When mono substituted benzene undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction, the rate of the reaction and the site of attack of the incoming electrophile depends on the functional group already attached to it. Some groups increase the reactivity of benzene ring and are known as activating groups. While others which decrease the reactivity are known as deactivating groups. We further divide




  

these groups into two categories depending on the way they influence the orientation of attack by the incoming groups. Those which increases electron density at ‘ortho’ and ‘para’ position are known as ortho- para directors while those which increase electron density at ‘meta’ position is known as meta-directors. Some examples of directive influence of functional groups in mono-substituted benzene are explained below.

**Ortho and para directing groups**

All the activating groups are ‘ortho- para’ directors. Example –OH, -NH2, -NHR, -NHCOCH3, -OCH3-CH3 – C2H5 etc. Let us consider the directive influences of phenolic (-OH) group. Phenol is the resonance hybrid of following structures.

OH

OH OH OH

OH

In these resonance structures, the (-) charge residue is present on ortho and para position of ring structure. It is quite evident that the lone pair of electron on the atom which is attached to the ring involves in resonance and makes the ring more electron rich than benzene. The electron  

density at ortho and parapositions increases as compared to the meta position. Therefore phenolic group activates the benzene ring for electrophilic attack at ‘ortho’ and ‘para positions and hence –OH group is an ortho- para director and activator.

In aryl halides, the strong –I effect of the halogens (electron withdrawing tendency) decreases the electron density of benzene ring, thereby deactivating for electrophilic attack. However the presence of lone pair on halogens involved in the resonance with pi electrons of benzene ring, increases electron density at ortho and para positions. Hence the halogen group is an ortho-para director and deactivator.

**META DIRECTING GROUPS**

Generally all deactivating groups are meta-directors. For example –NO2, -CN, -CHO, -COR, -COOH, -COOR, -SO3H etc. Let us consider the directive influence of aldehyde (-CHO) group. Benz aldehyde is the resonance hybrid of following structures.
