**4.1 Introduction**

Hydrogen is the simplest atom which contains one electron and one proton. In contrast to other elements (except helium) its valence electron is directly in the sphere of action of the nucleus. It is invariably present in most of the compounds we come across in our daily life such as water, carbohydrate, proteins etc. As it has an unpaired electron, it is reactive and exists as a diatomic molecule (H2). However, the abundance of hydrogen gas in the earth’s atmosphere is very small.

**4.1.1 Position in Periodic Table**

The hydrogen has the electronic configuration of 1s1 which resembles with ns1 general valence shell configuration of alkali metals and shows similarity with them as follows:

1\. It forms unipositive ion (H+) like alkali metals (Na+, K+, Cs+)

2\. It forms halides (HX), oxides (H2O), peroxides (H2O2) and sulphides (H2S) like alkali metals (NaX, Na2O, Na2O2, Na2S)

3\. It also acts as a reducing agent.

However, unlike alkali metals which have ionization energy ranging from 377 to 520 kJ mol-1, the hydrogen has 1,314 KJ mol-1 which is much higher than alkali metals.

Like the formation of halides (X-) from halogens, hydrogen also has a tendency to gain one electron to form hydride ion (H-) whose electronic configuration is similar to the noble gas, helium. However, the electron affinity of hydrogen is much less than that of halogen atoms. Hence, the tendency of hydrogen to form hydride ion  

is low compared to that of halogens to form the halide ions as evident from the following reactions:

½ H2 + e- → H- ΔH = + 36 kcal mol-1

½ Br2 + e- → Br- ΔH = - 55 kcal mol-1

Since, hydrogen has similarities with alkali metals as well as the halogens; it is difficult to find the right position in the periodic table. However, in most of its compounds hydrogen exists in +1 oxidation state. Therefore, it is reasonable to place the hydrogen in group 1 along with alkali metals as shown in the latest periodic table published by IUPAC.

**4.1.2 Isotopes of Hydrogen**

Hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, viz., protium (1H

1 or H), deuterium (1H

2 or D) and tritium (1H 3 or

T). Protium (1H 1) is the predominant form

(99.985 %) and it is the only isotope that does not contain a neutron.

Figure 4.1 Isotopes of hydrogen

Deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, constitutes about 0.015 %. The third isotope, tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen which occurs only in traces (~1 atom per 1018 hydrogen atoms). Due to the existence of these isotopes naturally occurring hydrogen exists as H2, HD, D2, HT, T2, and DT. The properties of these isotopes are shown in Table 4.1.

Ortho and para hydrogen are similar in chemical properties but differ in some of the physical properties. For example, the melting point of para hydrogen is 13.83 K while that of ortho hydrogen 13.95 K; boiling point of para hydrogen is 20.26 K while that of ortho hydrogen 20.39 K. Since the nuclear spins are in opposite directions the magnetic moment of para hydrogen is zero and ortho hydrogen has magnetic moment twice that of a proton.

**4.2 Preparation of Hydrogen**

High purity hydrogen (>99.9 %) is obtained by the electrolysis of water containing traces of acid or alkali or the electrolysis of aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide using a nickel anode and iron cathode. However, this process is not economical for large-scale production.

At anode : 2 OH- → H2O + ½ O2 + 2e-

At cathode : 2 H2O + 2 e- → 2 OH- + H2

Overall reaction : H2O → H2 + ½ O2

**4.2.1 Laboratory Preparation**

Hydrogen is conveniently prepared in laboratory by the reaction of metals, such as zinc, iron, tin with dilute acid.

Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl2 + H2↑

**Figure 4.2 Laboratory preparation of hydrogen**  

**4.2.2 Industrial Production**

In the large-scale, hydrogen is produced by steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. In this method hydrocarbon such as methane is mixed with steam and passed over nickel catalyst in the range 800-900 °C and 35 atm pressures.

CH4 + H2O CO + 3H2

In an another process, steam is passed over a red-hot coke to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The mixture of gases produced in this way is known as _water gas (CO+H2). This is also called syngas_ (Synthetic gas) as it is used in the synthesis of organic compounds such as methanol and simple hydrocarbons.

**Conversion of Carbon monoxide in water gas to Carbon dioxide:**

The carbon monoxide of the water gas can be converted to carbon dioxide by mixing the gas mixture with more steam at 400°C and passed over a shift converter containing iron/copper catalyst. This reaction is called as water-gas shift reaction.

CO + H2O → CO2 + H2

The CO2 formed in the above process is absorbed in a solution of potassium carbonate.

CO2 + K2CO3 + H2O → 2 KHCO3

**4.2.3 Preparation of Deuterium:**

**Electrolysis of heavy water:**

Normal water contains 1.6 x 10-4 percentage of heavy water. The dissociation of protium water (H2O) is more than heavy water (D2O). Therefore, when water is electrolysed, hydrogen is liberated much faster than D2. The electrolysis is continued until the resulting solution becomes enriched in heavy water. Further electrolysis of the heavy water gives deuterium.

**4.2.4 Preparation of Tritium:**

As explained earlier the tritium is present only in trace amounts. So it can be artificially prepared by bombarding lithium with slow neutrons in a nuclear fission reactor. The nuclear transmutation reaction for this process is as follows.

**4.3 Properties of Hydrogen**

**4.3.1 Physical Properties:**

Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, lightest and highly flammable gas. It is a non-polar diatomic molecule. It can be liquefied under low temperature and high pressure. Hydrogen is a good reducing agent. Various physical constants of hydrogen molecule are listed in Table 4.1.

**4.3.2 Chemical Properties:**

Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to give water. This is an explosive reaction and  

releases lot of energy. This is used in fuel cells to generate electricity.

2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O

Similarly, hydrogen also reacts with halogens to give corresponding halides. Reaction with fluorine takes place even in dark with explosive violence while with chlorine at room temperature under light. It combines with bromine on heating and reaction with iodine is a photochemical reaction.

H2 + X2 → 2 HX (X = F, Cl, Br & I)

In the above reactions the hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1. It also has a tendency to react with reactive metals such as lithium, sodium and calcium to give corresponding hydrides in which the oxidation state of hydrogen is -1.

2 Li + H2 → 2 LiH

2 Na + H2 → 2 NaH

These hydrides are used as reducing agents in synthetic organic chemistry. It is used to prepare other important hydrides such as lithium aluminium hydride and sodium boro hydride.

4 LiH + AlCl3 → Li\[AlH4\] + 3 LiCl

4 NaH + B(OCH3)3 → Na\[BH4\] + 3 CH3ONa

Hydrogen itself acts as a reducing agent. In the presence of finely divided nickel, it adds to the unsaturated organic compounds to form saturated compounds.

**4.3.3 Chemical properties of Deuterium**

Like hydrogen, deuterium also reacts with oxygen to form deuterium oxide called heavy water. It also reacts with halogen to give corresponding halides.

2 D2 + O2 → 2 D2O

D2 + X2 → 2 DX

(X = F, Cl, Br & I)

**Deuterium exchange reactions:**

Deuterium can replace reversibly hydrogen in compounds either partially or completely depending upon the reaction conditions. These reactions occur in the presence of deuterium or heavy water.

CH4 + 2 D2 → CD4 + 2 H2

2 NH3 + 3 D2 → 2 ND3 + 3 H2

**4.4 Uses of Hydrogen**

1\. Over 90 % hydrogen produced in industry is used for synthetic applications. One such process is Haber process which is used to synthesis ammonia in large scales. Ammonia is used for the manufacture of chemicals such as nitric acid, fertilizers and explosives.

2\. It can be used to manufacture the industrial solvent, methanol from carbon monoxide using copper as catalyst.

CO + 2H2 CH3OHCu

3\. Unsaturated fatty oils can be converted into saturated fats called Vanaspati (margarine) by the reduction reaction with Pt/H2.

4\. In metallurgy, hydrogen can be used to reduce many metal oxides to metals at high temperatures.

CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O

WO3 + 3 H2 → W + 3 H2O

5\. Atomic hydrogen and oxy-hydrogen torches are used for cutting and welding.

6\. Liquid hydrogen is used as a rocket fuel.

7\. Hydrogen is also used in fuel cells for generating electrical energy. The reversible uptake of hydrogen in metals is also attractive for rechargeable metal hydride battery.

**4.5 Compounds of Hydrogen**

**4.5.1 Water**

Water is one of the most abundant compounds of hydrogen and our earth’s surface contains approximately 70 % of ocean which is the major source of water. However, sea water contains many dissolved salts hence it can not be used directly. Water is essential for all living things and our body contains about 65% water.  

**Ortho-H2O**

**and Para-H2O**

Water exists in the interstellar clouds and icy satellites of the solar system. In particular, the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of water in space has recently received attention. Like hydrogen, water can also be classified into ortho-H2O, in which the spin directions of the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms are parallel, and para-H2O, in which the directions are antiparallel. OPR of H2(300K) on earth should be 3:1. OPR of H2O(50K) in interstellar clouds and comets should be 2:5:1.

**4.5.2 Physical Properties:**

Water is a colourless and volatile liquid. The peculiar properties of water in the condensed phases are due to the presence of inter molecular hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high melting and boiling points of water. Some of the physical parameters of water are listed in Table 4.2.

On the other hand, the halogens react with water to give an acidic solution. For example, chlorine forms hydrochloric acid and hypo chlorous acid. It is responsible for the antibacterial action of chlorine water, and for its use as bleach.

Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl

Fluorine reacts differently to liberate oxygen from water.

2F_2_ + 2 H_2_O → 4HF + O_2_

In a similar way, compounds of non- metals react with water to give acidic or alkaline solutions. For example, solutions of carbonates are slightly alkaline.

CO3 2− + H2O → HCO3

− + OH−

Water is an amphoteric oxide. It has the ability to accept as well as donate protons and hence it can act as an acid or a base. For example, in the reaction with HCl it accepts proton where as in the reaction with weak base ammonia it donates proton.

NH3 + H2O → NH4 + + OH−

HCl + H2O → H3O + + Cl−

Water dissolves ionic compounds. In addition, it also hydrolyses some covalent compounds.

SiCl4 + 2 H2O → SiO2 + 4 HCl

P4O10 + 6 H2O → 4 H3PO4

Many salts crystallized from aqueous solutions form hydrated crystals. The water in the hydrated salts may form co-ordinate bond or just present in interstitial positions of crystals.  

Examples: \[Cr(H2O)6\]Cl3 – All six water molecules form co-ordinate bond

BaCl2.2H2O – Both the water molecules are present in interstitial positions.

CuSO4.5H2O – In this compound four water molecules form co-ordinate bonds while the fifth water molecule, present outside the co-ordination, can form intermolecular hydrogen bond with another molecule. \[Cu(H2O)4\]SO4.H2O

**4.5.4 Hard and Soft Water:**

Hard water contains high amounts of mineral ions. The most common ions found in hard water are the soluble metal cations such as magnesium & calcium, though iron, aluminium, and manganese may also be found in certain areas. Presence of these metal salts in the form of bicarbonate,




  

chloride and sulphate in water makes water ‘hard’. When hard water is boiled carbonates of magnesium and calcium present in it gets precipitated. On the other hand, water free from soluble salts of calcium and magnesium is called soft water. The hardness of water is of two types, viz., temporary hardness and permanent hardness.

**Temporary Hardness and its removal:**

Temporary hardness is primarily due to the presence of soluble bicarbonates of magnesium and calcium. This can be removed by boiling the hard water followed by filtration. Upon boiling, these salts decompose into insoluble carbonate which leads to their precipitation. The magnesium carbonate thus formed further hydrolysed to give insoluble magnesium hydroxide.

Ca(HCO3)2 → CaCO3 + H2O + CO2

Mg(HCO3)2 → MgCO3 + H2O + CO2

MgCO3 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + CO2

The resulting precipitates can be removed by filtration.

Alternatively, we can use Clark’s method in which, calculated amount of lime is added to hard water containing the magnesium and calcium, and the resulting carbonates and hydroxides can be filtered- off.

Ca(HCO3)2 + Ca(OH )2 → 2CaCO3 + 2H2O

Mg (HCO3)2 + 2 Ca(OH )2

↓

2CaCO3 + Mg(OH)2 +2 H2O  

**Permanent Hardness:**

Permanent hardness of water is due to the presence of soluble salts of magnesium and calcium in the form of chlorides and sulphates in it. It can be removed by adding washing soda, which reacts with these metal (M = Ca or Mg) chlorides and sulphates in hard water to form insoluble carbonates.

MCl2 + Na2CO3 → MCO3 + 2 NaCl

MSO4 + Na2CO3 → MCO3 + Na2SO4

In another way to soften the hard water is by using a process called ion- exchange. That is, hardness can be removed by passing through an ion-exchange bed like zeolites or column containing ion- exchange resin. Zeolites are hydrated sodium alumino-silicates with a general formula, Na2O∙Al2O3∙_x_SiO2∙_y_H2O (_x_ = 2 to 10, _y_ = 2 to 6). Zeolites have porous structure in which the monovalent sodium ions are loosely held and can be exchanged with hardness producing metal ions (M = Ca2+ or Mg2+) in water. The complex structure can conveniently be represented as Na2-Z with sodium as exchangeable cations.

Na2-Z + M2+ → M-Z+ 2 Na+

When exhausted, the materials can be regenerated by treating with aqueous sodium chloride. The metal ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) caught in the zeolite (or resin) are released and they get replenished with sodium ions.

M-Z + 2NaCl → Na2-Z + MCl2

**4.6 Heavy Water:**

Heavy water (D2O) is the oxide of heavy hydrogen. One part of heavy water is present in 5000 parts of ordinary water. It is mainly obtained as the product of electrolysis of water, as D2O does not undergo electrolysis as easily as H2O.

D2O is a colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid. However, there is a marked difference between physical properties of water and heavy water as shown in Table 4.2.

**Hard water produces less foam with detergents. Do you know why?**

The cleaning capacity of soap is reduced when used in hard water. Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty acids (e.g., coconut oil). When soap is added to hard water, the divalent magnesium and calcium ions present in hard water react with soap. The sodium salts present in soaps are converted to their corresponding magnesium and calcium salts which are precipitated as scum/precipitate.

M2+ + 2RCOONa → (RCOO)2M + 2Na+ M = Ca or Mg R = C17H35

**4.6.1 Chemical properties of heavy water:**

When compounds containing hydrogen are treated with D2O, hydrogen undergoes an exchange for deuterium




  

2NaOH + D2O → 2NaOD + HOD

HCl + D2O → DCl + HOD

NH4Cl + 4D2O → ND4Cl + 4HOD

These exchange reactions are useful in determining the number of ionic hydrogens present in a given compound.

For example, when D2O is treated with of hypo-phosphorus acid only one hydrogen atom is exchanged with deuterium. It indicates that, it is a monobasic acid.

H3PO2 + D2O → H2DPO2 + HDO

It is also used to prepare some deuterium compounds:

Al4C3 + 12D2O → 4Al(OD)3 + 3CD4

CaC2 + 2 D2O → Ca(OD)2 + C2D2

Mg3N2 + 6D2O → 3Mg(OD)2 + 2 ND3

Ca3P2 + 6D2O → 3Ca(OD)2 + 2PD3

**4.6.2 Uses of heavy water:**

1\. Heavy water is widely used as moderator in nuclear reactors as it can lower the energies of fast neutrons

2\. It is commonly used as a tracer to study organic reaction mechanisms and mechanism of metabolic reactions

3\. It is also used as a coolant in nuclear reactors as it absorbs the heat generated.  

**4.7 Hydrogen Peroxide:**

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the most important peroxides. It can be prepared by treating metal peroxide with dilute acid.

BaO2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + H2O2

Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O2

On an industrial scale, hydrogen peroxide is now prepared exclusively by autoxidation of 2-alkyl anthraquinol.

**4.7.1 Physical properties:**

Pure hydrogen peroxide is almost a colorless liquid (pale blue), less volatile and more viscous than water.

A 30 % solution of hydrogen peroxide is marketed as ‘100-volume’ hydrogen peroxide indicating that at S.T.P., 100 ml of oxygen is liberated by 1 ml of this solution on heating.

**4.7.2 Chemical properties:**

Hydrogen peroxide is highly unstable and the aqueous solution spontaneously




  

disproportionates to give oxygen and water. The reaction is, however, slow but is explosive when catalyzed by metal. If it is stored in glass container, it dissolves the alkali metals from the glass, which catalyzes the disproportionation reaction. For this reason, H2O2 solutions are stored in plastic bottles.

H2O2 → H2O + ½O2

Hydrogen peroxide can act both as an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. Oxidation is usually performed in acidic medium while the reduction reactions are performed in basic medium

**In acidic conditions:**

H2O2 + 2 H+ +2 e- → 2 H2O (E0 = + 1.77 V)

For example

2FeSO4+H2SO4 + H2O2 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 2H2O

In basic conditions:

HO2 - + OH- →O2 + H2O + 2 e-

(E0 = + 0.08 V)

For Example,

2KMnO4 (aq) + 3 H2O2 (aq)

2MnO2 + 2 KOH + 2 H2O +3O2 (g)

**4.7.3 Uses of hydrogen peroxide:**

The oxidizing ability of hydrogen peroxide and the harmless nature of its products, i.e., water and oxygen, lead to its many applications. It is used in water treatment to oxidize pollutants, as a mild  

antiseptic, and as bleach in textile, paper and hair-care industry.

Hydrogen peroxide is used to restore the white colour of the old paintings which was lost due to the reaction of hydrogen sulphide in air with the white pigment Pb3(OH)2(CO3)2 to form black colored lead sulphide. Hydrogen peroxide oxidises black coloured lead sulphide to white coloured lead sulphate, there by restoring the colour.

PbS + 4H2O2 → PbSO4 + 4 H2O

**4.7.4 Structure of hydrogen peroxide:**

Both in gas-phase and solid-phase, the molecule adopts a skew conformation due to repulsive interaction of the OH bonds with lone-pairs of electrons on each oxygen atom. Indeed, it is the smallest molecule known to show hindered rotation about a single bond.

H2O2 has a non-planar structure. The molecular dimensions in the gas phase and solid phase differ as shown in figure 4.5. Structurally, H2O2 is represented by the dihydroxyl formula in which the two OH- groups do not lie in the same plane. One way of explaining the shape of hydrogen peroxide is that the hydrogen atoms would lie on the pages of a partly opened book, and the oxygen atoms along the spine. In the solid phase of molecule, the dihedral angle reduces to 90.2o due to hydrogen bonding and the O-O-H angle expands from 94.8 º to 101.9o.

**4.8 Hydrides**

Hydrogen forms binary hydrides with many electropositive elements including metals and non-metals. It also forms ternary hydrides with two metals. E.g., LiBH4 and LiAlH4. The hydrides are classified as ionic, covalent and metallic hydrides according to the nature of bonding. Hydrides formed with elements having lower electronegativity than hydrogen are often ionic, whereas with elements having higher electronegativity than hydrogen form covalent hydrides.

**Ionic (Saline) hydrides: These are** hydrides composed of an electropositive metal, generally, an alkali or alkaline-earth metal, except beryllium and magnesium, formed by transfer of electrons from metal to hydrogen atoms. They can be prepared by the reaction of elements at about 400° C. These are salt-like, high-melting, white crystalline solids having hydride ions (H−) and metal cations (Mn+).

2 Li + H2 → 2 LiH  

2 Ca + 2H2 → 2 CaH2

**Covalent (Molecular) hydrides:** They are compounds in which hydrogen is attached to another element by sharing of electrons. The most common examples of covalent hydrides of non-metals are methane, ammonia, water and hydrogen chloride. Covalent hydrides are further divided into three categories, viz., electron precise (CH4, C2H6, SiH4, GeH4), electron- deficient (B2H6) and electron-rich hydrides (NH3, H2O). Since most of the covalent hydrides consist of discrete, small molecules that have relatively weak intermolecular forces, they are generally gases or volatile liquids.

**Metallic (Interstitial) hydrides:** Metallic hydrides are usually obtained by hydrogenation of metals and alloys in which hydrogen occupies the interstitial sites (voids). Hence, they are called interstitial hydrides; the hydrides show properties similar to parent metals and hence they are also known as metallic hydrides. Most of the hydrides are non-stoichiometric with variable composition (TiH1.5-1.8 and PdH0.6-0.8), some are relatively light, inexpensive and thermally unstable which make them useful for hydrogen storage applications. Electropositive metals and some other metals form hydrides with the stoichiometry MH or sometimes MH2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Zn).

**4.9 Hydrogen Bonding**

Hydrogen bonding is one of the most important natural phenomena occurring in chemical and biological sciences. These interactions play a major role in the




  

structure of proteins and DNA. When a hydrogen atom (H) is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as fluorine (F) or oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N), the bond is polarized. Due to this effect, the polarized hydrogen atom is able to form a weak electrostatic interaction with another electronegative atom present in the vicinity. This interaction is called as a hydrogen bond (20-50 _kJ mol_−_1_) and is denoted by dotted lines (…).

It is weaker than covalent bond (> 100 _kJ mol_−_1_) but stronger than the van der Waals interaction (< 20 _kJ mol_−_1_). Hydrogen bond has profound effect on various physical properties including vapour pressure (H2O and H2S), boiling point, miscibility of liquids (H2O and C2H5OH), surface tension, densities, viscosity, heat of vaporization and fusion, etc. Hydrogen bonds can occur within a molecule (_intramolecular hydrogen bonding_) and between two molecules of the same type or different type (intermolecular _hydrogen bonding_).

**Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond**

Intramolecular hydrogen bonds are those which occur within a single molecule.

**Figure 4.6 Intramolecular hydrogen bonding**  

**Intermolecular hydrogen bond**

Intermolecular hydrogen bonds occur between two separate molecules. They can occur between any numbers of like or unlike molecules as long as hydrogen donors and acceptors are present in positions which enable the hydrogen bonding interactions. For example, intermolecular hydrogen bonds can occur between ammonia molecule themselves or between water molecules themselves or between ammonia and water.

Water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with one another. For example, each water molecule is linked to four others through hydrogen bonds. The shorter distances (100 pm) correspond to covalent bonds (solid lines), and the longer distances (180 pm) correspond to hydrogen bonds (dotted lines).

In ice, each atom is surrounded tetrahedrally by four water molecules through hydrogen bonds. That is, the presence of two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs of electron on oxygen atoms in each water molecule allows formation of a three-dimensional structure. This arrangement creates an open structure, which accounts for the lower density of ice compared with water at 0°C. While in liquid water, unlike ice where hydrogen bonding occurs over a long-range, the strong hydrogen bonding prevails only in a short range and therefore the denser packing.

**SUMM**

Hydrogen is the simplest atom which contains one electron and one proton. It has three isotopes namely protium, deuterium and tritium. The hydrogen exists as diatomic gaseous molecule. The molecule has two nuclear spin isomers namely ortho and para- hydrogen. Elemental hydrogen having an electronic configuration of 1s1, has properties similar to alkali metals as well as halogens. Based on its electronic configuration and existence of the +1 oxidation state in most of the compounds it is placed in group 1 along with alkali metals.

Hydrogen is prepared by the action of metal with mineral acids in laboratory. In industrial scale, hydrogen is produced by the steam-reforming of hydrocarbons. Deuterium can be synthesized by the electrolysis of heavy water, while the radioactive tritium is prepared by the nuclear transmutation reaction of lithium with slow neutrons.

Hydrogen reacts with nonmetals like oxygen and halogens to form water and hydrogen halides respectively. It reacts with metals to form metal hydrides. It acts as good reducing agent. Deuterium undergoes

exchange reactions with hydrogen. Tritium with a half-life period of 12.3 years and emits β-particles spontaneously. Hydrogen has many uses including in the preparation of ammonia, methanol, and hydrogenation of oils and reduction of metal oxides. It can also be used as fuel.

Water is an important amphoteric oxide of hydrogen and used a universal solvent. It hydrolyses oxides and forms metal hydroxides with metals such as sodium and barium. Due to the presence of soluble salts of calcium and magnesium in water, the water shows hardness. Clark's method can be used to remove temporary hardness. Like water, another important oxide is hydrogen peroxide. It is used as a mild antiseptic and as a bleaching agent in textile and paper industries. Hydrogen bound to strong electronegative atoms such as fluorine, nitrogen or oxygen atoms, forms a peculiar type of electrostatic interactions with another strong electronegative atom. This is called hydrogen bond. This is one of important interactions observed in many biological molecules such as proteins, DNA etc…
