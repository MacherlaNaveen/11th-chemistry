**GASEOUS STATE**

Jacques Charles (1746-1823)

So many properties of properties of matter, especially when in gaseous form, can be deduced from hypothesis that their minute parts are in rapid motion, the velocity increasing with temperature, that the precise nature of this motion becomes a subject of rational curiosity.

**6.1. Introduction**

We can survive for weeks without food, days without water, but only minutes without air. Thus, we inhale a lungful of air every few seconds, keep some of the molecules for our own end, and some of the molecules that our body no longer needs, and exhale the mixture back into the surrounding air. The air around us is in the gaseous state, which is the simplest of the states of matter. Although the chemical behaviour of gases depends on their composition, all the gases have remarkably similar physical behaviour.

Do you know the difference between gas and vapour?

Gas is a substance that is normally in a gaseous state at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, while vapour is the gaseous form of any substance that is a liquid or solid at room temperature and 1 atm pressure.

Earth is surrounded by an atmosphere of air whose composition in volume percentage is roughly 78 % nitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 1 % other gases. Of the known elements, only eleven are gases under normal atmospheric conditions. The elements hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), fluorine (F2) and chlorine (Cl2) exist as gaseous diatomic molecules. Another form of oxygen, namely, ozone (O3) is also a gas at room temperature. The noble gases, namely, helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe) and radon (Rn) of 18th group are monatomic gases. Compounds such as carbon monoxide  

(CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO) also exist in gaseous state under normal atmospheric conditions. In this unit you will learn the properties of gases and other related phenomena.

**6.2. The Gas Laws**

The gas laws have played a major role in the development of chemistry. The physical properties of all gases are governed by the gas laws that were formulated based on the studies of the properties like pressure, volume, etc., as a function of temperature. Before studying the gas laws in detail, let us understand an important parameter, namely, the pressure.

Pressure is defined as force divided by the area to which the force is applied. The SI unit of pressure is pascal which is defined as 1 Newton per square meter (Nm-2). There are other units that are commonly used and their relation with the SI unit is as follows.

**6.2.1 Boyle’s Law: Pressure-Volume Relationship**

Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments to study the relation between the pressure and volume of gases. The schematic of the apparatus used by him is shown in figure 6.1.

**Figure. 6.1 Boyle’s law experiment**

Mercury was added through the open end of the apparatus such that the mercury level on both ends are equal as shown in the figure 6.1(a). Add more amount of mercury until the volume of the trapped air is reduced to half of its original volume as shown in figure 6.1(b). The pressure exerted on the gas by the addition of excess mercury is given by the difference in mercury levels of the tube. Initially the pressure exerted by the gas is equal to 1 atm as the difference in height of the mercury levels is zero. When the volume is reduced to half, the difference in mercury levels increases to 760 mm. Now the pressure exerted by the gas is equal to 2 atm. It led him to conclude that at a given temperature the volume occupied by a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.

Mathematically, the Boyle’s law can be written as

PV = k ------ (6.2a)(at constant temperature and mass) Boyle’s law is applicable to all gases regardless of their chemical identity (provided the pressure is low). Therefore, for a given mass of a gas under two different sets of conditions at constant temperature we can write P1V1 = P2V2 = k ------ (6.3)

The PV relationship can be understood as follows. The pressure is due to the force of the gas particles on the walls of the container. If a given amount of gas is compressed to half of its volume, the density is doubled and the number of particles hitting the unit area of the container will be doubled. Hence, the pressure would increase twofold.

**Consequence of Boyle’s law**

The pressure-density relationship can be derived from the Boyle’s law as shown below.

**All the passenger aeroplane cabins have to be artificially pressurised. do you know why?**

Most commercial aeroplanes fly at about 30,000 feet altitude. The pressure decreases with the increase in altitude as there are fewer molecules per unit volume of air. Hence, while at air, the pressure around the aeroplane will be so low that one could pass out for lack  

of oxygen. For this reason aeroplanes cabins are artificially pressurized.

Similarly, the effect of drop in pressure is felt as a little pain in the ears by a person while ascending a mountain in a plain. Though the external pressure drops, the internal pressure within the ear cavities remains the same. This creates an imbalance. The greater internal pressure forces the eardrum to bulge outward causing pain. The excess air within the ear cavities escapes after some time and with the help of yawning and thereby equalizing the internal and external pressure to relieve the pain.

P1V1 = P2V2 = P3V3

1\. Freon-12, the compound widely used in the refrigerator system as coolant causes depletion of ozone layer. Now it has been replaced by eco-friendly compounds. Consider 1.5 dm3 sample of gaseous Freon at a pressure of 0.3 _atm_. If the pressure is changed to 1.2 _atm_. at a constant temperature, what will be the volume of the gas increased or decreased?

2\. Inside a certain automobile engine, the volume of air in a cylinder is 0.375 dm3, when the pressure is 1.05 _atm_. When the gas is compressed to a volume of 0.125 dm3 at the same temperature, what is the pressure of the compressed air?  

**6.2.2 Charles Law (Volume-temperature relationship)**

The relationship between volume of a gas and its temperature was examined by J. A. C. Charles. He observed that for a fixed mass of a gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its temperature (K). Mathematically it can be represented as (at constant P and n)

V = kT ------- (6.5)

or V T

\= Constant

If the temperature of the gas increases, the volume also increases in direct proportion, so that V

T is a constant.

For example, if a balloon is moved from an ice cold water bath to a boiling water bath, the temperature of the gas increases. As a result, the gas molecules inside the balloon move faster and gas expands. Hence, the volume increases.

**Variation of volume with temperature at constant pressure**

The plot of the volume of the gas against its temperature at a given pressure




  

is shown in the figure 6.5. From the graph it is clear that the volume of the gas linearly increases with temperature at a given pressure. Such lines are called isobars. It can be expressed by the following straight line equation.

V = mT + C where T is the temperature in degree Celsius and m & C are constants.

When T= 0 ºC the volume becomes V0. Hence, V0 = C and slope of the straight line m is equal to ΔV / ΔT. Therefore the above equation can be written in the following form.

If we extrapolate the straight line in the figure 6.5 beyond the experimental measurements, the straight line intersects the temperature axis (x-axis) at -2730 C. This shows that the volume of the gas becomes zero at -2730 C, more precisely this temperature is -273.150 C. Beyond this temperature the gas would have a negative volume which is physically impossible. For this reason, this temperature was defined as absolute zero by Kelvin and he proposed a new temperature scale with absolute zero as starting point which is now called Kelvin scale. The only difference between the Kelvin scale of temperature and Celsius scale of temperature is that the zero position is shifted. The boiling and freezing point of water in both scales are given below.

**6.4 Mixture of gases - Dalton’s law of partial pressures**

Studies of non-reacting gaseous mixtures showed that in a gaseous mixture each component behaves independently. For a gaseous mixture, it is important to know, how the pressure of individual component contributes to the total pressure of the mixture.

John Dalton stated that "the total




  

pressure of a mixture of non-reacting gases is the sum of partial pressures of the gases present in the mixture" where the partial pressure of a component gas is the pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the same volume and temperature. This is known as _Dalton’s law of partial pressures_.

_i.e.,_ for a mixture containing three gases 1, 2 and 3 with partial pressures p1, p2 and p3 in a container with volume V, the total pressure Ptotal will be give by

Ptotal = p1 + p2 + p3 ------- (6.12)

**Application of Dalton’s law**

In a reaction involving the collection of gas by downward displacement of water, the pressure of dry vapor collected can be calculated using Dalton’s law.

Pdry gas collected = ptotal – pwater vapour

pwater vapour is generally referred as aqueous tension and its values are available for air at various temperatures.

Let us understand Dalton's law by solving this problem. A mixture of gases contains 4.76 mole of Ne, 0.74 mole of Ar and 2.5 mole of Xe. Calculate the partial pressure of gases, if the total pressure is 2 _atm_. at a fixed temperature.

**6.4.1 Graham’ s Law of Diffusion**

Gases have a tendency to occupy all the available space. When two non -reactive gases are allowed to mix, the gas molecules migrate from region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This property of gas which involves the movement of the gas molecules through another gases is called diffusion. Effusion is another process in which a gas escapes from a container  

through a very small hole.

**6.5 Deviation from ideal gas behaviour**

The kinetic theory of gases (postulates of kinetic theory of gases are described in physics text book) which is the basis for the gas equation (PV=nRT),  

assumes that the individual gas molecules occupy negligible volume when compared to the total volume of the gas and there is no attractive force between the gas molecules. Gases whose behaviour is consistent with these assumptions under all conditions are called ideal gases. But in practice both these assumptions are not valid under all conditions. For example, the fact that gases can be liquefied shows that the attractive force exists among molecules. Hence, there is no gas which behaves ideally under all conditions. The non-ideal gases are called real gases. The real gases tend to approach the ideal behaviour under certain conditions.

**6.5.1 Compressibility factor Z**

The deviation of real gases from ideal behaviour is measured in terms of a ratio of PV to nRT. This is termed as compressibility factor. Mathematically,

Z PV nRT

\=

For ideal gases PV = nRT, hence the compressibility factor, Z = 1 at all temperatures and pressures. For these gases the plot of Z vs P should be a straight line parallel to the pressure axis. When a gas deviates from ideal behaviour, its Z value deviates from unity. For all gases, at very low pressures and very high temperature the compressibility factor approaches unity and they tend to behave ideally. The plot of the compressibility factor vs pressure for some common gases are shown in Figure 6.8.

When the pressure is low, the volume of the container is very large compared to the volume of the gas molecules so that individual volume of the gas molecules can be neglected. In addition, the molecule in a gas are far apart and attractive forces are negligible. As the pressure increases,

the density of gas also increases and the molecules are much closer to one another. Hence, the intermolecular force becomes significant enough to affect the motion of the molecules and the gas will not behave ideally.

At high temperatures the average kinetic energy of the molecules is very high and hence inter moleclular attractions will become insignificant. As the temperature

decreases, the average kinetic energy of molecules also decreases, hence the molecular attraction is enhanced. The temperature at which a real gas obeys ideal gas law over an appreciable range of pressure is called Boyle temperature or Boyle point. The Boyle point varies with the nature of the gas. Above the Boyle point, for real gases, Z > 1, ie., the real gases show positive deviation. Below the Boyle point, the real gases first show a decrease for Z, reaches a minimum and then increases with the increase in pressure. So, it is clear that at low pressure and at high temperature, the real gases behave as ideal gases.

**6.5.3 Van der Waals Equation**

J. D. Van der Waals made the first mathematical analysis of real gases. His  

treatment provides us an interpretation of real gas behaviour at the molecular level. He modified the ideal gas equation PV = nRT by introducing two correction factors, namely, pressure correction and volume correction.

**Pressure Correction:**

The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the force created by the bombardment of molecules on the walls of the container. The speed of a molecule moving towards the wall of the container is reduced by the attractive forces exerted by its neighbours. Hence, the measured gas pressure is lower than the ideal pressure of the gas. Hence, van der Waals introduced a correction term to this effect.

**Figure. 6.10 Inter-molecular forces of attraction**

Van der Waals found out the forces of attraction experienced by a molecule near the wall are directly proportional to the square of the density of the gas.

**Volume Correction**

As every individual molecule of a gas occupies a certain volume, the actual volume is less than the volume of the container, V. Van der Waals introduced a correction factor V' to this effect. Let us calculate the correction term by considering gas molecules as spheres.

The constants _a_ and _b_ are van der Waals constants and their values vary with the nature of the gas. It is an approximate formula for the non-ideal gas.

**6.6 Pressure-Volume isotherms of Carbon dioxide**

**Andrew's isotherm**

Thomas Andrew gave the first complete data on pressure-volume- temperature of a substance in the gaseous and liquid states. He plotted isotherms of carbon dioxide at different temperatures which is shown in Figure. 6.12. From the plots we can infer the following.




  

At low temperature isotherms, for example, at 130 C as the pressure increases, the volume decreases along AB and is a gas until the point B is reached. At B, a liquid separates along the line BC, both the liquid and gas co-exist and the pressure remains constant. At C, the gas is completely converted into liquid. If the pressure is higher than at C, only the liquid is compressed so, there is no significant change in the volume. The successive isotherms shows similar trend with the shorter flat region. i.e. The volume range in which the liquid and gas coexist becomes shorter. At the temperature of 31.1 0C the length of the shorter portion is reduced to zero at point P. In other words, the CO2 gas is liquefied completely at this point. This temperature is known as the liquefaction temperature or critical temperature of CO2. At this point the pressure is 73 atm. Above this temperature CO2 remains as a gas at all pressure values. It is then proved that many real gases behave in a similar manner to carbon dioxide.

Though the nature of isotherm remains similar, the critical temperature, the corresponding pressure and volume are characteristics of a particular gas.

Now we can define the critical constants as follows. Critical temperature (Tc) of a gas is defined as the temperature above which it cannot be liquefied even at high pressure. Critical pressure (Pc) of a gas is defined as the minimum pressure required to liquefy 1 mole of a gas at its critical temperature. Critical volume (Vc) is defined as the volume occupied by 1 mole of a gas at its critical temperature and critical pressure. The critical constants of some common gases are given in Table 6.2

**6.7 Liquefaction of gases**

For important commercial operations such as LPG and rocket fuels, we require gases in their liquid state. The liquefication methods are based on the Joule-Thomson effect. He observed appreciable cooling when the compressed gas is forced through an orifice plug into  

a low-pressure region. This phenomenon of lowering of temperature when a gas is made to expand adiabatically from a region of high pressure into a region of low pressure is known as Joule- Thomson effect. This effect is observed only below a certain temperature, which is a characteristic one for each gas. This temperature below which a gas obeys Joule-Thomson effect is called inversion temperature (Ti). This value is given using van der waals constants _a_ and _b_.

T a Rbi = 2

\--------- (6.34)

Gases like O2, He, N2 and H2 have very low Tc, hence Joule-Thomson effect can be applied for cooling effectively. At the inversion temperature, no rise or fall in temperature of a gas occurs while expanding. But above the inversion temperature, the gas gets heated up when allowed to expand through a hole.

There are different methods used for liquefaction of gases:

1) In **Linde’s method,** Joule-Thomson effect is used to get liquid air or any other gas.

2) In **Claude’s process,** the gas is allowed to perform mechanical work in addition to Joule-Thomson effect so that more cooling is produced.

3) In **Adiabatic process,** cooling is produced by removing the magnetic property of magnetic material such as gadolinium sulphate. By this method, a temperature of 10-4 K i.e. as low as 0 K can be achieved.
