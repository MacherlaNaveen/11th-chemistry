## 8.5 Homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibriam

8.5.1 Homogeneous equilibrium

In a homogeneous equilibrium, all the reactants and products are in the same phase.

For example:

H2 (g) + I2 (g) ⇌ 2HI (g)

In the above equilibrium, H2, I2 and HI are in the gaseous state.

Similarly, for the following reaction, all the reactants and products are in homogeneous solution phase.  

CH3COOCH3(aq)+H2O(aq)

⇌

CH3COOH(aq)+CH3OH (aq)

8.5.2 Heterogeneous equilibrium

If the reactants and products of a reaction in equilibrium, are in different phases, then it is called as heterogeneous equilibrium.

Example:

H2O (l) ⇌ H2O (g)

CaCO3 (s) ⇌ CaO (s) + CO2 (g)
