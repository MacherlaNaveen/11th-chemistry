Claude Louis Berthollet, a Savoyard-French chemist, studied the mechanism of reversible chemical reaction and developed the theory of chemical equilibria. He also contributed to modern chemical nomenclature. He was the first to demonstrate the bleaching action of chlorine gas, and developed a solution of sodium hypochlorite that acts as a bleaching agent.
